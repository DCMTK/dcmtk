  converted upside down.
  Affects: dcmdata/libi2d/i2dbmps.cc

**** Changes from 2009.08.11 (riesmeier)

- Slightly modified code in order to avoid warning messages on MSVC compiler.
  Affects: dcmdata/apps/pdf2dcm.cc

- Updated man pages.
  Affects: doxygen/manpages/man1/*

**** Changes from 2009.08.10 (eichelberg)

- Added working implementation of DcmRLECodecDecoder::decodeFrame().
  Thanks to Tom Clune for contributing this code.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcrleccd.cc

- CMake now recognizes the compiler name when spelled in uppercase
  or lowercase (e.g. CL.EXE or cl.exe). Needed to make VC6 work.
  Also updated default for libtiff to v3.8.2.
  Affects: CMakeLists.txt

- All decompression codecs now replace NumberOfFrames if larger than one
  or present in the original image.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcrleccd.cc
           dcmjpeg/libsrc/djcodecd.cc
  Affects: dcmjpls/libsrc/djcodecd.cc

- Cleaned up Makefile dependencies: Some files contained dependencies
  from the libxml include files which cause compilation to file when compiling
  without libxml support.
  Affects: dcmdata/apps/Makefile.dep
           dcmsr/apps/Makefile.dep
           dcmsr/libsrc/Makefile.dep

- Changed package version scheme: development snapshots now receive an odd
  number at the last position of the version number, i.e. currently it is
  "3.5.5". The macro PACKAGE_DATE is set to "CVS" by default but will be
  replaced by the current date for publicly available snapshots. From now on,
  official releases will always have an even number at the last position.
  Affects: CMakeLists.txt

**** Changes from 2009.08.03 (eichelberg)

- In order to reduce the probability of generating duplicate UIDs when one
  process is spawned immediately after termination of another one, and both
  use the same process ID and generate UIDs within the same second of
  system time (which may happen if a command line tool is implemented that
  just generates and prints a single UID and then terminates, and that tool
  is called repeatedly from a shell script), initialize the counter
  component of the UID with a sub-second fraction from the system time
  (microseconds on Posix systems, milliseconds on Win32).
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcuid.cc

- Fixed possible buffer overflow in UID generation code when UID root too
  long. Now printing warning message to stderr when truncating a UID.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcuid.cc

  compactAfterTransfer now makes sure that the memory is released once the
  write operation has finished, so that only a single fragment at a time
  needs to fully reside in memory.

**** Changes from 2008.05.29 (eichelberg)

- Experimental implementation of decodeFrame method for
  JPEG decoder added.
  Affects: dcmjpeg/libsrc/djcodecd.cc

- Implemented new method DcmPixelData::getUncompressedFrame
  that permits frame-wise access to compressed and uncompressed
  objects without ever loading the complete object into main memory.
  For this new method to work with compressed images, all classes derived from
  DcmCodec need to implement a new method decodeFrame(). For now, only
  dummy implementations returning an error code have been defined.

- Implemented new method createValueFromTempFile that allows the content of
  a temporary file to be set as the new value of a DICOM element.
  Also added a new method compact() that removes the value field if the
  value field can still be reconstructed from file. For large attribute
  value the file reference is now kept in memory even when the value has
  been loaded once. Finally, added new helper method getUncompressedFrameSize
  that computes the size of an uncompressed frame for a given dataset.
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dcelem.h
           dcmdata/libsrc/dcelem.cc

- Implemented new classes DcmTempFileHandler and DcmInputTempFileStreamFactory
  that perform thread-safe reference counted life cycle management of a
  temporary file and are needed for DcmElement temporary file extensions to come.
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dcistrmf.h
           dcmdata/libsrc/dcistrmf.cc

  Affects: dcmimgle/include/dcmtk/dcmimgle/ditranst.h

- Now the c't scaling algorithm is used as a fallback if the preferred
  algorithm with interpolation is not applicable.
  Affects: dcmimgle/include/dcmtk/dcmimgle/discalet.h

- Fixed bug in c't scaling algorithm (reducePixel) which could cause a crash.
  Thanks to Alexander Fedotov <fedotov@elektron.ru> for the bug report.
  Affects: dcmimgle/include/dcmtk/dcmimgle/discalet.h

  Affects: dcmimage/apps/dcm2pnm.cc
           dcmimage/apps/dcmscale.cc

- Enhanced error message when scaling process or grayscale conversion fail.
  Affects: dcmimage/apps/dcm2pnm.cc

- Use the pbmplus scaling algorithm as the second best fallback if the c't
  algorithm cannot be used (e.g. up and down-scaling on different axes).
  Affects: dcmimgle/include/dcmtk/dcmimgle/discalet.h

- Fixed problem with wrong interpretation of the palette descriptor in certain
  cases. Now the BitsPerTableEntry stored in the LUT descriptor is used by
  default. The previous behavior can be enabled using the ELM_CheckValue mode.
  Thanks to Ewald de Vries <ewald.de.vries@medstreaming.com> for the report.

- Refactored findscu code into class DcmFindSCU, which is now part of the dcmnet
  library, and a short command line tool that only evaluates command line
  parameters and then makes use of this class. This facilitates re-use of the
  findscu code in other applications.

- When writing DICOM data to file, we now by default split fwrite() calls for
  very large attributes into multiple calls, none of which writes more than
  32 MBytes. This is a workaround to a bug in most MSVC environments (MSDN
  KB899149) and is hardly relevant performance-wise. Previous behaviour can
  be enforced by compiling with WRITE_VERY_LARGE_CHUNKS defined.
  Affects: config/docs/macros.txt
