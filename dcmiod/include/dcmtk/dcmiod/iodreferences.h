 *  different types of references for different purposes: Sometimes only SOP
 *  Class UID and SOP Instance UID are required, sometimes also Series and

 *  different attributes to store those references in objects. Sometimes the
 *  same references are even required in different structures within the same
 *  object.
 *  This class can carry identifiers for Patient, Study, Series and Instance
 *  level and can be passed around in order to write them as required into
 *  the attribute structures needed by a specific DIOCM IOD, module or macro.
