.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Command line program that converts VeriLUM file with characteristic curve data (\fICCx_xx\&.dat\fP) to a format used for the Barten transformation in this toolkit\&. VeriLUM is a calibration package from ImageSmiths consisting of a photometer (with serial RS232 connector) and a Windows NT software\&.

.nf
in-file   VeriLUM characteristic curve file to be converted

ambient   ambient light (cd/m^2, floating point value)

.SH "NOTES"
.PP
The output file describing the characteristic curve of a display system (monitor) is a simple text file\&. Lines starting with a '#' are treated as comments and therefore skipped as well as blank lines\&. This conversion program creates such a file automatically (including some comment lines) by transforming the information stored in the VeriLUM file\&. The number following the magic word 'max' defines the maximum DDL value (e\&.g\&. 255 for 8 bit displays)\&. This definition is required before the luminance data can be defined\&. Optionally the ambient light value can be specified in this file too\&. The floating point value (in candela per square meter) must follow the word 'amb'\&. Finally the luminance values are defined for each corresponding DDL (digital driving level) value\&. The entries do not necessarily have to be ordered or complete, i\&.e\&. there can be less than 'max' + 1 entries\&. Missing values are calculated by cubic spline interpolation\&.
