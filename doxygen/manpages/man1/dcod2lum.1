dcod2lum \- Convert hardcopy characteristic curve file to softcopy format

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Command line program that converts a hardcopy characteristic curve file to softcopy format\&. In other words, the measured optical density (OD) values from the input file are transformed to the luminance space according to the formula:
.PP
.PP
.nf
  L = La + L0 * 10^(-D)
.fi
.PP
.PP
where \fIL\fP is the resulting luminance, \fILa\fP is the reflected ambient light and \fIL0\fP the illumination (both measured in cd/m^2), 'D' the optical density (OD)\&. Please note that if no illumination value is specified in the input file (keyword \fIlum\fP) all optical density values are mapped to a constant luminance\&.
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.PP
.PP
.nf
in-file   hardcopy characteristic curve file to be converted

out-file  softcopy characteristic curve file to be written

.SH "NOTES"
.PP
The format of both input and output file is described the documentation of the \fBdcmdspfn\fP command line tool\&. In addition, the \fIdata\fP folder contains sample characteristics file monitors, cameras, printers and scanners\&.
