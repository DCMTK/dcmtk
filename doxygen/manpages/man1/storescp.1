.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBstorescp\fP application implements a Service Class Provider (SCP) for the Storage Service Class\&. It listens on a specific TCP/IP port for incoming association requests from a Storage Service Class User (SCU) and can receive both DICOM images and other DICOM composite objects\&. The \fBstorescp\fP application also supports the Verification Service Class as an SCP\&.

.SH "NOTES"
.PP
The semantic impacts of the above mentioned options is clear for the majority of options\&. Some particular options, however, are so specific that they need detailed descriptions which will be given in this passage\&.
.PP
Option \fI--sort-conc-studies\fP enables a user to sort all received DICOM objects into different subdirectories\&. The sorting will be done with regard to the studies the individual objects belong to, i\&.e\&. objects that belong to the same study will be stored in the same subdirectory\&. In general, a DICOM object d_n+1 is considered to belong to the same study as a DICOM object d_n if and only if d_n and d_n+1 show the exact same values in attribute Study Instance UID\&. The names of the resulting subdirectories always start with a prefix p which was passed to this option as a parameter\&. In addition to this prefix, the subdirectory names contain time stamp information with regard to the date and time of reception of this particular study's first DICOM object\&. In detail, the determination of the subdirectory names pertains to the pattern
.PP
.PP
.nf
  [prefix]_[YYYYMMDD]_[HHMMSSPPP]
.fi
.PP
.PP
where YYYY refers to year (4 digits), MM to month (01-12), DD to day (01-31), HH to hour (00-23), MM to minute (00-59), SS to second (00-59) and PPP to milliseconds (000-999)\&. If the prefix is an empty string, the first '_' is omitted\&.
.PP
The other \fI--sort-xxx\fP options work in a similar manner, only the subdirectory names are created differently\&. For option \fI--sort-on-study-uid\fP the pattern is
.PP
.PP
.nf
  [prefix]_[StudyInstanceUID]
.fi
.PP
.PP
and for option \fI--sort-on-patientname\fP
.PP
.PP
.nf
  [PatientName]_[YYYYMMDD]_[HHMMSSPPP]
.fi
.PP
.PP
where 'PatientName' is replaced by 'ANONYMOUS' if the data element is empty or absent in the data set\&. Any existing patient name is transformed in order to use only ASCII characters\&. Please note that in this context only the DICOM default character set (ASCII, i\&.e\&. no entry in attribute Specific Character Set) and Latin-1 (Specific Character Set valued 'ISO_IR 100') are supported\&. If another character set is found and the patient name contains non-ASCII characters, a warning is printed and the transformation is performed as if Latin-1 character set would be set in the file\&. This may lead to unreadable or unexpected patient name directories and behaviour\&. Thus, it is advisable to use \fI--sort-on-patientname\fP only if Latin-1 or ASCII patient names are expected to be received\&.
.PP
For option \fI--sort-on-study-uid\fP the same subdirectory will be used for all DICOM objects that belong to the same study, i\&.e\&. in contrast to the other \fI--sort-xxx\fP options there is no guarantee that a study directory is ever completed\&.
.PP
Option \fI--timenames\fP creates filenames from timestamps corresponding to the time, \fBstorescp\fP writes a file to disk\&. The format is
.PP
.PP
.nf
  [YYYYMMDDHHMMSSPPP]_[SERIALNO].[MD]
.fi
.PP
.PP
where YYYY, MM, DD, HH, MM, SS, PPP are interpreted as described above\&. If more files are created at the same time, SERIALNO is inserted\&. It consists of a 4-digit, consecutive number (0000 to 9999)\&. For the first file, that exists for a specific time, no number (and no '_') is inserted at all\&. MD represents an identification code (2 letters) for the kind of object stored in the file (see notes on \fI--rename-on-eostudy\fP)\&.
.PP
Option \fI--filename-extension\fP appends a specified suffix to each filename (a dot '\&.' is not added automatically)\&. This suffix is not appended to the filenames created by \fI--rename-on-eostudy\fP to maintain the length of 8 characters\&.
.PP
Option \fI--exec-on-reception\fP allows one to execute a certain command line after having received and processed one DICOM object (through a C-STORE-RQ message)\&. The command line to be executed is passed to this option as a parameter\&. The specified command line may contain a number of placeholders which will be replaced at run time:
.PP
.PD 0
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fB#p:\fP complete path to the output directory into which the last DICOM object was stored (not available with option \fI--ignore\fP though)
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fB#f:\fP filename of the current output file (not available with option \fI--ignore\fP though)
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fB#a:\fP calling application entity title of the peer Storage SCU
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fB#c:\fP called application entity title used by the peer Storage SCU to address \fBstorescp\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fB#r:\fP calling presentation address, i\&.e\&. hostname or IP address of the peer Storage SCU
.PP
The specified command line is executed as a separate process, so that the execution of \fBstorescp\fP will not be held back\&. This behavior can be influenced with the \fI--exec-sync\fP option\&.
.PP
Option \fI--exec-on-eostudy\fP allows one to execute a certain command line when all DICOM objects that belong to one study have been received by \fBstorescp\fP\&. The same placeholders as with \fI--exec-on-reception\fP may be used, except for '#f', which is not supported\&. A study is considered complete by \fBstorescp\fP when an object belonging to a different study is received or the timeout specified with \fI--eostudy-timeout\fP takes place\&. If option \fI--rename-on-eostudy\fP is in force, the renaming takes place before the external command is executed\&.
.PP
Option \fI--rename-on-eostudy\fP refers to the above mentioned \fI--sort-xxx\fP options and can only be used in combination with one of these options\&. If a user specifies option \fI--rename-on-eostudy\fP and \fBstorescp\fP determines that all DICOM objects that belong to a certain study have been received, all DICOM files that belong to the last study will be renamed in the corresponding output directory\&. The filenames into which the files are being renamed will be calculated using the pattern
.PP
.PP
.nf
  [prefix][consecutive numbering]
.fi
.PP
.PP
where [prefix] is a 2 character prefix that reveals the kind of DICOM object stored in the file and [consecutive numbering] is a consecutively numbered, 6-digit number, starting at '000001'\&. In general, the question if all DICOM objects that belong to one study have been received by \fBstorescp\fP will be answered positively if and only if two consecutively received DICOM objects d_n and d_n+1 do not show the same values in attribute Study Instance UID; in such a case, d_n+1 is considered to belong to a new study\&.
.PP
Using option \fI--eostudy-timeout\fP a user can modify the determination process to figure out if all DICOM objects that belong to one study have already been received by \fBstorescp\fP\&. With regard to this fact, it is clear that this option can only be used in combination with at least one of the following options: \fI--sort-xxx\fP, \fI--exec-on-eostudy\fP and \fI--rename-on-eostudy\fP\&. If option \fI--eostudy-timeout\fP is specified, the end of a study is considered to have occurred not only if two consecutively received DICOM objects d_n and d_n+1 do not show the same values in attribute Study Instance UID, but also if within a time span of x seconds after the reception of a DICOM object d_n, no other DICOM object was received over the network\&. Note that the amount x of seconds (which determines the length of this time span) has to be passed to this option as a parameter\&.
.PP
Please note that two consecutive network connections can transfer objects for the same study\&. The study will only be considered complete when an object of a different study is received or the \fI--eostudy-timeout\fP is reached\&. For this reason, the options \fI--fork\fP and \fI--inet\fP are incompatible with \fI--exec-on-eostudy\fP, \fI--rename-on-eostudy\fP and \fI--sort-conc-studies\fP\&.

The default behavior of the \fBstorescp\fP application is to prefer transfer syntaxes having an explicit encoding over the default implicit transfer syntax\&. If \fBstorescp\fP is running on big-endian hardware it will prefer BigEndianExplicit to LittleEndianExplicit transfer syntax (and vice versa)\&. This behavior can be changed with the \fI--prefer\fP options (see above)\&. Using option \fI--accept-all\fP any of the following transfer syntaxes is supported:

Additional Storage SOP Classes and Transfer Syntaxes can be used with the so-called 'association negotiation profiles' (see below)\&.
.PP
The \fBstorescp\fP application does not support extended negotiation by default\&. However, using an appropriate association negotiation profile (see below) the optional support for extended negotiation can be added to particular SOP classes\&.
.SS "Access Control"
When compiled on Unix platforms with TCP wrapper support, host-based access control can be enabled with the \fI--access-control\fP command line option\&. In this case the access control rules defined in the system's host access control tables for \fBstorescp\fP are enforced\&. The default locations of the host access control tables are \fI/etc/hosts\&.allow\fP and \fI/etc/hosts\&.deny\fP\&. Further details are described in \fBhosts_access\fP(5)\&.
.SS "Running storescp from inetd"
On Posix platforms, \fBstorescp\fP can be initiated through the inetd(8) super server\&. This requires that \fBstorescp\fP be configured in the \fI/etc/inetd\&.conf\fP configuration file\&. A typical configuration line could look like this:
.PP
.PP
.nf
acr-nema stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/storescp -id +ac -od /tmp/storescp
.fi
.PP
.PP
where \fI-id\fP (\fI--inetd\fP) activates the inetd mode in which the DICOM association is actually accepted by inetd and passed to \fBstorescp\fP, \fI+ac\fP (\fI--access-control\fP) activates the TCP wrapper based access control described above and \fI-od\fP (\fI--output-directory\fP) defines the directory in which \fBstorescp\fP stores incoming DICOM objects\&. Note that the service name ('acr-nema' in this example) determines the port number on which DICOM associations are accepted and must be defined in \fI/etc/services\fP\&. When running from inetd, the stdout and stderr streams are discarded\&. However, you can still configure logging via the \fI--log-config\fP option (see below)\&.
.PP
Please note that when run through inetd, \fBstorescp\fP is executed with root privileges, which may be a security risk\&.
.SS "Association Negotiation Profiles and Configuration Files"
\fBstorescp\fP supports a flexible mechanism for specifying the DICOM network association negotiation behavior, based on so-called 'association negotiation
profiles' which may be read from a configuration file\&. The format and semantics of this configuration file are documented in \fIasconfig\&.txt\fP\&.
.SH "LOGGING"
.PP
The level of logging output of the various command line tools and underlying libraries can be specified by the user\&. By default, only errors and warnings are written to the standard error stream\&. Using option \fI--verbose\fP also informational messages like processing details are reported\&. Option \fI--debug\fP can be used to get more details on the internal activity, e\&.g\&. for debugging purposes\&. Other logging levels can be selected using option \fI--log-level\fP\&. In \fI--quiet\fP mode only fatal errors are reported\&. In such very severe error events, the application will usually terminate\&. For more details on the different logging levels, see documentation of module 'oflog'\&.
.PP
In case the logging output should be written to file (optionally with logfile rotation), to syslog (Unix) or the event log (Windows) option \fI--log-config\fP can be used\&. This configuration file also allows for directing only certain messages to a particular output stream and for filtering certain messages based on the module or application where they are generated\&. An example configuration file is provided in \fI<etcdir>/logger\&.cfg\fP\&.
.SH "COMMAND LINE"
.PP
All command line tools use the following notation for parameters: square brackets enclose optional values (0-1), three trailing dots indicate that multiple values are allowed (1-n), a combination of both means 0 to n values\&.
.PP
Command line options are distinguished from parameters by a leading '+' or '-' sign, respectively\&. Usually, order and position of command line options are arbitrary (i\&.e\&. they can appear anywhere)\&. However, if options are mutually exclusive the rightmost appearance is used\&. This behavior conforms to the standard evaluation rules of common Unix shells\&.
.PP
In addition, one or more command files can be specified using an '@' sign as a prefix to the filename (e\&.g\&. \fI@command\&.txt\fP)\&. Such a command argument is replaced by the content of the corresponding text file (multiple whitespaces are treated as a single separator unless they appear between two quotation marks) prior to any further evaluation\&. Please note that a command file cannot contain another command file\&. This simple but effective approach allows one to summarize common combinations of options/parameters and avoids longish and confusing command lines (an example is provided in file \fI<datadir>/dumppat\&.txt\fP)\&.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.PP
The \fBstorescp\fP utility will attempt to load DICOM data dictionaries specified in the \fIDCMDICTPATH\fP environment variable\&. By default, i\&.e\&. if the \fIDCMDICTPATH\fP environment variable is not set, the file \fI<datadir>/dicom\&.dic\fP will be loaded unless the dictionary is built into the application (default for Windows)\&.
.PP
The default behavior should be preferred and the \fIDCMDICTPATH\fP environment variable only used when alternative data dictionaries are required\&. The \fIDCMDICTPATH\fP environment variable has the same format as the Unix shell \fIPATH\fP variable in that a colon (':') separates entries\&. On Windows systems, a semicolon (';') is used as a separator\&. The data dictionary code will attempt to load each file specified in the \fIDCMDICTPATH\fP environment variable\&. It is an error if no data dictionary can be loaded\&.
