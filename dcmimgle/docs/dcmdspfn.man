\section dcmdspfn_synopsis SYNOPSIS

\verbatim
dcmdspfn [options]
\endverbatim

\section dcmdspfn_description DESCRIPTION

Command line program converts a DCMTK monitor / camera / printer / scanner
characteristics file to tabbed text file describing the characteristic curve
(CC), the display function and the post-standardized curve (PSC) for an 8 bit
display.  The 256 values of each curve can be visualized by a common spread
sheet program.  Above that the display curve (without CC and PSC) can also be
computed for a specified luminance/OD range (min/max) and a certain number of
Digital Driving Levels (DDL).

\section dcmdspfn_notes NOTES

The output file describing the CC, GSDF or CIELAB and PSC for an 8 bit display
system (monitor, camera, printer or scanner) is a simple text file.  Lines
starting with a '#' are treated as comments and, therefore, skipped as well as
blank lines.  An input file can for instance be created by the command line
tool \b dconvlum.

The ambient light value possibly defined in the characteristics file is also
used for the calculation.  In this case the value is part of the file comment
header as well as the number of DDL (digital driving level) values, the
absolute luminance range (measured in candela per square meter) and the range
of the JND index (just noticeable difference) in case of GSDF.  Alternatively,
the ambient light value can be specified as a command line option.  When
setting the two luminance values instead of reading a monitor characteristic
file as input the luminance range is linearly divided by the number of DDLs.

For printers and scanners the illumination can be specified in addition to the
reflected ambient light (both in the characteristics file and on the command
line).  The header of the output file includes the minimum and maximum Optical
Density (OD) instead of the luminance range.  Please note that the OD values
in the input file have to be ordered in descending order (in contrast to the
luminance values used for monitors and cameras).  The DDL value 0 always means
black (darkest value) and the maximum DDL value means white (brightest value,
clear film).

The \e data folder contains sample characteristics file for monitors,
cameras, printers and scanners.  See DICOM standard part 14 for more details
on display calibration and Barten's model (including GSDF).

\section dcmdspfn_logging LOGGING

The level of logging output of the various command line tools and underlying
libraries can be specified by the user.  By default, only errors and warnings
are written to the standard error stream.  Using option \e --verbose also
informational messages like processing details are reported.  Option
\e --debug can be used to get more details on the internal activity, e.g. for
debugging purposes.  Other logging levels can be selected using option
\e --log-level.  In \e --quiet mode only fatal errors are reported.  In such
very severe error events, the application will usually terminate.  For more
details on the different logging levels, see documentation of module "oflog".

In case the logging output should be written to file (optionally with logfile
rotation), to syslog (Unix) or the event log (Windows) option \e --log-config
can be used.  This configuration file also allows for directing only certain
messages to a particular output stream and for filtering certain messages
based on the module or application where they are generated.  An example
configuration file is provided in <em>\<etcdir\>/logger.cfg</em>.

\section dcmdspfn_command_line COMMAND LINE

All command line tools use the following notation for parameters: square
brackets enclose optional values (0-1), three trailing dots indicate that
multiple values are allowed (1-n), a combination of both means 0 to n values.

Command line options are distinguished from parameters by a leading '+' or '-'
sign, respectively.  Usually, order and position of command line options are
arbitrary (i.e. they can appear anywhere).  However, if options are mutually
exclusive the rightmost appearance is used.  This behavior conforms to the
standard evaluation rules of common Unix shells.

In addition, one or more command files can be specified using an '@' sign as a
prefix to the filename (e.g. <em>\@command.txt</em>).  Such a command argument
is replaced by the content of the corresponding text file (multiple
whitespaces are treated as a single separator unless they appear between two
quotation marks) prior to any further evaluation.  Please note that a command
file cannot contain another command file.  This simple but effective approach
allows one to summarize common combinations of options/parameters and avoids
longish and confusing command lines (an example is provided in file
<em>\<datadir\>/dumppat.txt</em>).
