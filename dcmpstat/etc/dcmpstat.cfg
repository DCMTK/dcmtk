[[COMMUNICATION]]
# ============================================================================

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The following text documents all settings defined for a local or remote
# storage or print application. Each application or communication target
# requires one section with a unique section title.
#
# [COMMUNICATION_PEER_1]
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The following entry defines which DICOM services are offered by the
# application described in this section. Four types are supported:
#
# STORAGE - a remote DICOM Storage Service Class SCP. Entries of this type are
#   shown as "send targets" in the DICOMscope browser GUI.  An entry of this
#   type is also required for each system that wants to download objects
#   from the DICOMscope database using Query/Retrieve.  The settings from
#   this section are used to resolve an application entity title into the
#   target hostname and IP port number.
#
# RECEIVER - a local DICOM Storage Service Class SCP which accepts incoming
#   images and stores them in the local database.
#
# PRINTER - a remote DICOM Print Management Service Class SCP.
#   For each entry of this type, a separate Print SCU ("spooler process")
#   is started together with DICOMscope.
#   Entries of this type are shown as printers in the DICOMscope
#   print preview GUI.
#
# LOCALPRINTER - a DICOM Print Management SCP that is running as part of
#   the DICOMscope software on the local system.  For each entry of this
#   type both a DICOM Print SCP and a Print SCU (spooler) are started
#   together with DICOMscope. This allows DICOMscope to print "to itself".
#
# Default value for this setting is: STORAGE.
#
# type = LOCALPRINTER
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Hostname: The IP number or domain name of the communication partner in
# conventional TCP/IP notation. For entries of type LOCALPRINTER this setting
# must have the value "localhost". This setting is mandatory, no default.
#
# hostname = localhost
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# IP port number under which the application or remote peer receives DICOM
# associations.
#
# port = 104
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Human readable description of the communication partner. Used in the GUI to
# present the communication partner to the application user in selection boxes.
#
# description = Local DICOM Print SCP
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# For outgoing connections (STORAGE, PRINTER) this setting contains the
# called application entity title of the communication partner.
# For incoming connections (RECEIVER, LOCALPRINTER) this setting contains
# the responding application entity used during association negotiation.
#
# aetitle = DICOM_PRINTER
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Only negotiate the default Implicit VR Little Endian transfer syntax for
# all abstract syntaxes. This setting is useful if we're communicating with
# very old DICOM software which claims to support Explicit VR communication
# but fails to do so...  Optional setting, default is: false.
#
# ImplicitOnly  = false
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Do not create data types (VRs) that were defined in post-1993 editions
# of the DICOM standard when converting implicit VR files to explicit VR
# network transmission. Maybe necessary for old DICOM Store SCPs.
# Optional setting, default is: false.
#
# DisableNewVRs = false
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Maximum PDU (protocol data unit) size to negotiate for incoming PDUs.
# Value must be between 4096 and 131072. Default is 16384.
#
# MaxPDU = 32768
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Timeout (in seconds) for outgoing connection requests, must be larger
# than zero. Optional setting, default is Unlimited (wait for TCP/IP timeout).
#
# Timeout = 5
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Use the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol for image transmission
# in accordance with the DICOM Security Enhancements One (Supplement 31).
# Optional setting, default is: false.
#
# UseTLS = false
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Filename of the X.509 certificate to be used for TLS authentication.
# The file should be located in the directory specified by
# GENERAL/TLS/TLSDIRECTORY.
#
# SCP usage: The TLS protocol requires that a TLS server
# must have a certificate. Therefore, this parameter is mandatory.
# If absent, the certificate file is loaded from "sitecert.pem" in the
# TLS directory.
#
# SCU usage: For a TLS client the certificate is optional.
# Therefore, this setting is optional for Store SCUs.  If absent, no
# TLS authentication is performed for the client. Warning: Anonymous TLS
# may be susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.
#
# Certificate = cert.pem
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Filename of the private key "matching" the certificate,
# to be used for TLS authentication. The file should be located in the
# directory specified by GENERAL/TLS/TLSDIRECTORY.
#
# SCP usage: The TLS protocol requires that a TLS server
# must have a certificate. Therefore, this parameter is mandatory.
# If absent, the certificate file is loaded from "sitekey.pem" in the
# TLS directory.
#
# SCU usage: For a TLS client the certificate is optional.
# Therefore, this setting is optional for Store SCUs.  If absent, no
# TLS authentication is performed for the client. Warning: Anonymous TLS
# may be susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.
#
# PrivateKey = pkey.pem
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Private keys may be stored in encrypted form (e.g. 3DES),
# protected with a password. Since the DICOMscope Store SCU/SCP processes
# do not have any interaction with the user, they cannot request a password
# from the command line.  Two options are available to the user:
# - the private key can be unencrypted. In this case this setting should
#   be absent from the config file. Users should carefully adjust file system
#   access rights to the private key file to make sure that the private key
#   is not compromised (e.g. copied by an unauthorized used).
# - the private key can be encrypted, with the password in clear text in this
#   configuration file.  In this case, the DICOMscope configuration file must
#   be protected from read access by unauthorized users, otherwise the private
#   key may be compromised as well.
# A real secure approach would be to keep the private key in a safe place,
# e.g. in a microprocessor card, but this is not yet supported.
#
# PrivateKeyPassword = Should_be_kept_secret
#

#   BCP195-EX:  Extended BCP 195 TLS Profile
#   AES:        AES TLS Secure Transport Connection Profile (retired)
#   BASIC:      Basic TLS Secure Transport Connection Profile (retired)
#   NULL:       Authenticated unencrypted communication (retired)
#
# TLSProfile = BCP195
#
# Note 1: The direct configuration of a list of ciphersuites using the
# "CipherSuites" configuration setting is not supported anymore;
# this setting will be ignored.
#
# Note 2: The BCP195 profile, which is the default, provides backwards
# compatibility with older implementations only supporting the AES or
# BASIC profile.
#
# Note 3: The BASIC profile requires 3DES to be enabled in the OpenSSL
# library that DCMTK is compiled with. Starting with OpenSSL 1.1.0, this
# has to be manually enabled at compile time.
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This setting defines the policy for handling the remote peer's TLS
# certificate. Known terms are:
#   REQUIRE: verify peer certificate, refuse transmission if absent
#   VERIFY:  verify peer certificate if present
#   IGNORE:  don't verify peer certificate
# Optional setting, default is: REQUIRE.

# Optional setting, default is: false. Not used for Storage type entries.
#
# SupportsPresentationLUT = true
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The 1999 edition of the DICOM standard contains an inconsistency in the
# definition of the Presentation LUT SOP class.  The attributes
# "Referenced Presentation LUT", "Illumination" and "Reflected Ambient Light"
# can either be part of the Basic Film Session or be part of the Basic Film
# Box. DICOM Correction Proposal CP 173 defines that these attributes
# have to be specified on Basic Film Box level.  However, not all existing
# Print SCPs supporting the Presentation LUT SOP Class are implemented
# in accordance with CP 173. Both Print SCU and Print SCP can, therefore,
# be configured to use either Film Session or Film Box (but never both).
#
# Print SCU usage: If flag is true, transmit attributes in the Basic Film
# session instead of the Basic Film Box.
# Print SCP usage: If flag is true, attributes are accepted and returned

# of entries in a Presentation LUT matches the bit depth of the image pixel
# data (4096 entries for 12 bit pixel data, 256 entries for 8 bit pixel
# data).
#
# Print SCU usage: If flag is true, assume that Print SCP requires match
# between Presentation LUT and image data. If for a given print job this
# match cannot be guaranteed, perform rendering of the Presentation LUT in
# the Print SCU and use an IDENTITY Presentation LUT shape in the Print SCP.
# Print SCP usage: If flag is true, enforce a matching rule as described
