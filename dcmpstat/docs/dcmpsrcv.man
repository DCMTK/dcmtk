\section dcmpsrcv_synopsis SYNOPSIS

\verbatim
dcmpsrcv [options] config-file
\endverbatim

\section dcmpsrcv_description DESCRIPTION

The \b dcmpsrcv application is invoked by the Grayscale Softcopy Presentation
State Viewer and is not intended to be invoked manually.  The application
reads the common configuration file which is shared between the different
components of the viewer and opens a TCP/IP socket on which incoming
association requests are accepted.  The application sparks a separate
process for each DICOM connection.  It supports the same storage SOP classes
as the \b storescp utility as SCP, but does not support encapsulated transfer
syntaxes.  Incoming images are stored in the common viewer database.  See the
full conformance statement for further details.

\section dcmpsrcv_logging LOGGING

The level of logging output of the various command line tools and underlying
libraries can be specified by the user.  By default, only errors and warnings
are written to the standard error stream.  Using option \e --verbose also
informational messages like processing details are reported.  Option
\e --debug can be used to get more details on the internal activity, e.g. for
debugging purposes.  Other logging levels can be selected using option
\e --log-level.  In \e --quiet mode only fatal errors are reported.  In such
very severe error events, the application will usually terminate.  For more
details on the different logging levels, see documentation of module "oflog".

In case the logging output should be written to file (optionally with logfile
rotation), to syslog (Unix) or the event log (Windows) option \e --log-config
can be used.  This configuration file also allows for directing only certain
messages to a particular output stream and for filtering certain messages
based on the module or application where they are generated.  An example
configuration file is provided in <em>\<etcdir\>/logger.cfg</em>.

\section dcmpsrcv_command_line COMMAND LINE

All command line tools use the following notation for parameters: square
brackets enclose optional values (0-1), three trailing dots indicate that
multiple values are allowed (1-n), a combination of both means 0 to n values.

Command line options are distinguished from parameters by a leading '+' or '-'
sign, respectively.  Usually, order and position of command line options are
arbitrary (i.e. they can appear anywhere).  However, if options are mutually
exclusive the rightmost appearance is used.  This behavior conforms to the
standard evaluation rules of common Unix shells.

In addition, one or more command files can be specified using an '@' sign as a
prefix to the filename (e.g. <em>\@command.txt</em>).  Such a command argument
is replaced by the content of the corresponding text file (multiple
whitespaces are treated as a single separator unless they appear between two
quotation marks) prior to any further evaluation.  Please note that a command
file cannot contain another command file.  This simple but effective approach
allows one to summarize common combinations of options/parameters and avoids
longish and confusing command lines (an example is provided in file
<em>\<datadir\>/dumppat.txt</em>).

\section dcmpsrcv_environment ENVIRONMENT

The \b dcmpsrcv utility will attempt to load DICOM data dictionaries specified
in the \e DCMDICTPATH environment variable.  By default, i.e. if the
\e DCMDICTPATH environment variable is not set, the file
<em>\<datadir\>/dicom.dic</em> will be loaded unless the dictionary is built
into the application (default for Windows).

The default behavior should be preferred and the \e DCMDICTPATH environment
variable only used when alternative data dictionaries are required.  The
\e DCMDICTPATH environment variable has the same format as the Unix shell
\e PATH variable in that a colon (":") separates entries.  On Windows systems,
a semicolon (";") is used as a separator.  The data dictionary code will
attempt to load each file specified in the \e DCMDICTPATH environment variable.
It is an error if no data dictionary can be loaded.
