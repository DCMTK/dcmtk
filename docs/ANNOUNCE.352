ANNOUNCEMENT

Version 3.5.2 of the OFFIS DCMTK (DICOM ToolKit) software is now available
for public release.  This release includes the following main changes 
over the previous version (Version 3.5.1):

- Better ISO C++ compliance. If available, the standard header
  files such as <iostream> and <cmath> are used instead of the
  traditional <iostream.h> and <math.h> headers. 
  Visual C++ users are strongly advised to read the platform
  notes in the INSTALL file concerning iostream issues.

- DCMTK 3.5.2 builds correctly with GCC 3.2 and Visual C++ .NET

- Various enhancements in the configure system which now works
  correctly without manual interaction on more platforms: Irix,
  HP/UX 10 and MacOS X 10.2 now build "out of the box".

- Support for encoding/decoding RLE compressed DICOM images has been 
  added. The new tools dcmcrle and dcmdrle allow to convert between 
  uncompressed and RLE compressed transfer syntaxes.

- Support for zlib compressed (deflated) DICOM objects has been added.
  Conversion between uncompressed and deflated transfer syntaxes 
  is offered by dcmconv. 

- The new application dcmscale allows to scale DICOM images.

- The new application dcm2xml converts DICOM objects to XML.

- The new application dcmquant converts any DICOM color image into
  a palette color image. The underlying quantization classes are useful
  for creating palette color icons from color images.

- The Worklist CTN has been replaced by a completely new implementation 
  (module dcmwlm) that supports a larger set of keys, fixes various 
  issues with the old implementation and has a well-defined backend that 
  facilitates adaptation to databases etc.

- Most command line tools now support a command line option "--version" 
  which prints the host platform and the name and version number of 
  external libraries.

- Echoscu now supports C-ECHO over TLS (Security Enhancements One).

- Added support for new value representation Other Float String (OF).

- New layout for dcmdump tool, improves readability.

- Conversion between floating point numbers and ASCII strings (e.g. in
  DICOM DS data elements) is now performed in a locale independent manner,
  making sure that DCMTK works correctly in a non-Posix locale.

- Complete re-design of the DICOM I/O stream classes, required for
  zlib support. Critical API change. Programmers are advised to adapt
  their applications to the new DcmFileFormat loadFile() and saveFile()
  methods which encapsulate the new stream architecture.

- Support for private tag data dictionaries has been added. This can be
  activated in configure using the --with-private-tags option. By default,
  no private tag dictionary is installed.

- Unknown undefined length attributes are now converted into SQ instead of UN.

- Improved behaviour when reading elements with illegal odd tag length. 

- Many network tools now have a command line option --timeout for 
  controlling the connection request timeout.

- A-ASSOCIATE user information sub items are now always sent in ascending
  order to avoid problems with certain other DICOM toolkits.

- Added experimental "promiscuous" mode to storescp. In this mode,
  activated by the --promiscuous command line option, all presentation
  contexts not known not to be Storage SOP Classes are accepted.

- Added --max-send-pdu option to storescu that allows to 
  restrict the size of outgoing P-DATA PDUs.

- Added support for the Numeric Value Qualifier Code Sequence 
  (introduced with CP 260) to dcmsr module.

- Added support for the Current Requested Procedure Evidence Sequence 
  and the Pertinent Other Evidence Sequence to the dcmsr module.

- Dcmmkdir tool supports more application profiles.

- Algorithm for creation of unique identifiers has been improved on
  Win32 platforms where gethostid() is not available.

- The DICOM data dictionary has been re-worked based on the latest 
  supplements and correction proposals, as usual.

- Many bug fixes and minor improvements as usual - See the CHANGES.352
  file for more details.
