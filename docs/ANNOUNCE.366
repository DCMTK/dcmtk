ANNOUNCEMENT

Version 3.6.6 of the OFFIS DCMTK (DICOM ToolKit) software is now available for
public release.  This release includes the following main changes over the
previous version 3.6.5:

- DCMTK 3.6.6 builds correctly on older and up-to-date versions of GNU gcc
  (4.2.1 to 10.2.0) Clang (3.4.2 to 11.0.0), Apple Clang 11.0.0,
  Microsoft Visual Studio (2008 to 2019) and SunPro CC (5.14 and 5.15).

- Tested with the following operating systems/environments:
  - Android on arm64
  - Cygwin on x86_64
  - FreeBSD on x86_64
  - Linux on x86_64 and x86
  - MacOS X on x86_64
  - NetBSD on x86_64
  - OpenBSD on x86_64
  - OpenIndiana on x86
  - Solaris on x86
  - Windows (including MinGW and Cygwin) on x86_64 and x86

  For a complete list of tested systems and compilers, see the INSTALL file.

- Updated data dictionary, SOP classes, well-known frame of references,
  transfer syntaxes, code definitions and supported context group classes for
  DICOM standard release 2020e.

- Added new DCMTK module dcmect, which facilitates creation, loading, (partly)
  modification and storing Enhanced CT objects:

  - Also included is a general Concatenation API that allows for creating and
    re-assembling Concatenations from given DICOM datasets. Right now, only
    uncompressed ("unencapsulated") pixel data is supported.

  - The existing Segmentation API (dcmseg) as well as the new Enhanced CT API
    (dcmect) both support writing and reading Concatenations via dedicated
    methods.

  - Thanks to GE Aviation for sponsoring this feature.

- Major revision of JSON export tool (dcm2json), which should now be fully
  standard compliant.

- Major revision of the dcmsign module, which now supports Elliptic Curve
  (ECDSA) signatures, the DICOM SR RSA Digital Signature Profile, and CRLs in
  hashed certificate directories.  During signature verification the chain of
  trust for the signer certificates are now fully checked and there is limited
  support for the creation and verification of trusted timestamps.

- Added support for the Rendition Selection Document IOD, which has been
  introduced with Supplement 202 (Real-Time Video), to the dcmsr module.

- Added support for the new Waveform Storage SOP Classes that have been
  introduced with Supplement 217 (Neurophysiology Waveforms) to the DICOMDIR
  generation code and to the dcmsr module.

- Added support for the new 2nd generation RT Storage SOP Classes that have
  been introduced with Supplement 175, 176 and 199, as well as for the new
  Encapsulated OBJ and MTL Storage SOP Classes (Supplement 208) to the
  DICOMDIR generation code.

- Added TLS support to the DcmSCP and DcmSCPPool classes and to the dcmrecv
  command line tool.

- Updated and completely revised DIMSE Status Code definitions.  Now, the
  definitions and also the log output are consistent with the current edition
  of the DICOM standard.

- Significant performance enhancements for code that gets an item from or
  inserts an item into a sequence with a large number of items.

- DCMTK now successfully compiles when UNICODE/_UNICODE is defined on Windows.

- When compiling on Windows, new CMake options can now be used to control the
  Win32 build model (multi-threaded or multi-threaded DLL).

- Fixed various issues that occurred after the official 3.6.5 release.
  See CHANGES file for details.
