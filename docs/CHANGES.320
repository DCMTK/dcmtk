- Corrected usage string in dcmdump
  Affects: dcmdata/apps/dcmdump.cc

- Add method canWriteXfer to class DcmObject and all derived classes.
  This method checks whether it is possible to convert the original
  transfer syntax to an new transfer syntax. The check is used in the
  dcmconv utility to prohibit the change of a compressed transfer
  syntax to a uncompressed.

  configure if it exists in non-Unix environments.
  Affects: config/include/osconfig.h

**** Changes from 97.05.23 (eichelberg)

- Fixed a bug in storescu application: -u option did not work correctly.
  Affects: dcmnet/apps/storescu.cc

- Major rewrite of storescp application. New features:
  - network transfer syntax negotiation behaviour can be controlled
  - files can be written with or without Metaheader
  - file encoding (transfer syntax, group lengths etc.) can be controlled
  - bypass mode implemented which writes data directly to file as a "snapshot"
    of the network data stream. This prevents dcmdata from changing the dataset
    i.e. by recomputing group lengths.
  Changes required to interfaces of some DIMSE functions.

- Added method DcmDataDictionary::isDictionaryLoaded() to ask if a full
  data dictionary has been loaded.  This method should be used in tests
  rather that querying the number of entries (a sekelton dictionary is
  now always present).
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dcdict.h
           dcmdata/libsrc/dcdict.cc

**** Changes from 97.05.20 (eichelberg)

  when transmission of a non-image IOD (i.e. visit IOD) was attempted.
  Affects: dcmnet/apps/storescu.cc

**** Changes from 97.05.20 (barth)

- Removed obsolete applications file2ds and ds2file. The functionality of these
  applications is now peformed by dcmconv. Unified calling parameters
  are implemented in dump2dcm, dcmdump and dcmconv.

  Affects: dcmdata/Makefile.in

- Reactivate addUL in dimcmd.cc to add group length attribute explicit
  to command dataset.
  Affects: dcmnet/libsrc/dimcmd.cc

- Revised handling of GroupLength elements and support of
  DataSetTrailingPadding elements. The enumeratio E_GrpLenEncoding
  got additional enumeration values (for a description see dctypes.h).
  addGroupLength and removeGroupLength methods are replaced by
  computeGroupLengthAndPadding. To support Padding, the parameters of
  element and sequence write functions changed.

- Added a new method calcElementLength to calculate the length of an
  element, item or sequence. For elements it returns the length of
  tag, length field, vr field, and value length, for item and
  sequences it returns the length of the whole item. sequence including
  the Delimitation tag (if appropriate).  It can never return
  UndefinedLength.

- Bug fix for changing binary element values. If a binary existing element
  value changed, byte order was somtimes wrong.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcelem.cc

**** Changes from 97.05.13 (hewett)

- Updated data dictionary for Final Text versions
  of Supplements 4 (X-Ray Angio), 6 (X-Ray Radiofluoroscopy)
  and 11 (Radiotherapy).  Added UIDs and data dictionary attributes
  for the draft supplements 12 (PET), 13 (Queue Management),
  15 (Visible Light), 17 (Modality Performed Procedure Step), 22 (User
  Preference LUT) and 24 (Print Storage).  Updated UID tables so that
  recompiled Storage SCP/SCU's will handle the new SOPs.

- Modified the data dictionary parse code so that it can handle VM
  descriptions of the form "2-2n" (as used in some supplements).
  Currently, a VM of "2-2n" will be represented internally as "2-n".
  Also added preload of a few essential attribute descriptions into
  the data dictionary (e.g. Item and ItemDelimitation tags).
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcdict.cc
           dcmdata/include/dcdict.h

**** Changes from 97.05.12 (Barth)

**** Changes from 97.05.09 (hewett)

- Added improved error/warning messages and backup of existing DICOMDIR
  file (the backup file has the suffix .BAK and is removed if the new
  DICOMDIR file is successfully created).
  Affects: dcmdata/apps/dcmgpdir.cc

- Fixed bug related to renaming of temporary files accross file system
  boundaries (the rename() system call fails).  The temporary file used
  diring creation of a DICOMDIR is now created in the same file system
  directory as the DICOMDIR.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcdicdir.cc

- Added a member variable and associated get/set methods to DcmDirectoryRecord
  to allow the origin of a directory record to be noted.
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dcdirrec.h
           dcmdata/libsrc/dcdirrec.cc

**** Changes from 97.05.07 (barth)

- Corrected error reading ItemDelimitationItem using explicit
  transfer syntaxes
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcitem.cc

**** Changes from 97.05.05 (hewett)

- Added program (dcmftest) to test if a file uses the DICOM Part 10
  Format.  The program terminates with exit code 0 if file looks
  Part 10 conform.  This program is useful in Unix shell scripts.
  Added: dcmdata/apps/dcmftest.cc

- Added several new capabilities to the dcmgpdir program:
  1. the +r option now enables resursion of a directory tree searching for
     image files to add to the directory.
  2. the +m option allows lowercase filenames and filenames with trailing
     point ('.') to used.  References within the DICOMDIR will be converted
     to uppercase and the trailing point removed.  This allows images to be
     read directly from ISO9660 file-systems under Solaris (and probably other
     OS's which automatically convert filenames on ISO9660 file-systems).
  3. the +I option allows values for missing attributes to be invented.  Some
     type 1 attributes in the DICOMDIR are only type 2 in images.  See the
     documentation for more details.
  4. Series, Image, Curve, Overlay, ModalityLUT and VOILUT records are now
     inserted into the DICOMDIR based on the ordering defined by the *Number
     (e.g. ImageNumber) attributes (if present).

- Deleted (unreleased) trivial image checking program dcmchk.  Its capabilities
  have been merged with the comprehensive image validation package dcmcheck.
  The dcmcheck package is not distributed as part of the public release.  It
  must be obtained separately.
  Deleted: dcmdata/apps/dcmchk.cc

- Deleted the programs which attempted convertion from DICOM images to PPM
  images and vice versa.  These programs were very restricted in their
  capabilities.  Equivalent, greatly extended, versions of these programs
  are now part of a separate DICOM image handling package (dcmimage).  The
  dcmimage package can handle any type of DICOM image.  The dcmimage package
  is not distributed as part of the public release.  It must be obtained
  separately.

- Deleted the obsolete program mknldir which created an empty DICOMDIR.  This
  program has been superceeded by dcmgpdir which can generate a general
  purpose DICOMDIR.
  Deleted: dcmdata/apps/mknldir.cc

- When trying to locate referenced files in a DICOMDIR a possible trailing
  point ('.') is now taken into account if the referenced file cannot be
  found.  The DICOMDIR does not allow a trailing point in filenames but
  some ISO9660 file-system drivers automatically append a '.'.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcdirrec.cc

- Temporary DICOMDIR files are now located in the tmp directory using
  the tmpnam() function (if available).  Previously, temporary files
  were being created in the current working directory.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcdicdir.cc

- The DcmTag::getVMMax() method now returns a maximum value if the attribute
  is unknown.  This makes the default VM=1-n (before it was VM=1).
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dctag.h

- The maximum length of the internal VR's for PixelSequences and PixelItems
  has been set to undefined (previously it was zero).
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcvr.cc

- Added a "before" flag to the insertion of items into Directory Records
  and Pixel Sequences for compatibility with insertion in normal Sequences.
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dcdirrec.h
           dcmdata/include/dcpixseq.h

**** Changes before 97.05.05 (hewett/eichelberg/barth)

- Removed unused constant DICOM_MAXPRESENTATIONCONTEXTS.
  Affects: dcmnet/include/assoc.h

- Fixed several bugs in the DICOM Upper Layer state machine,
  following a bug report from B. Gorissen (Philips Medical Systems).
  1. A-ASSOCIATE PDUs were rejected when they were larger than the upper limit
     for P-DATA PDUs.
  2. Buffer overruns in PDU decoding were never checked/detected.
     This could cause applications to fail when very large non-P-DATA PDUs were
     received.
  3. A-ASSOCIATE PDUs were always read into an 8 KByte buffer, although no such
     limitation is defined in DICOM Part 8. Now the buffer is allocated
     dynamically.
  4. A temporary buffer used for assembling the A-ASSOCIATE PDU was too small.
     Buffer overruns (causing a core dump) could happen for large A-ASSOCIATE
     PDUs.
  A test application tests/assctest.cc has been added. This is a modified
  echoscu which allows to propose a selectable number of SOP classes and
  transfer syntax during association negotiation. It can be used to track
  down limitations in the association negotiation code.
  The number of transfer syntaxes supported during association negotiation
  has been increased from 5 to 25.

  attributes (file offsets were not being computed correctly).
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dcdicdir.h

- Fixed DICOMDIR generation bug affecting ordering of
  patient/study/series/image records (item insertion into a sequence
  did produce the expected ordering).

- Fixed attempt to print null pointer in debugging output.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcdirrec.cc

- Removed multiple occurrence of dcmutil.cc / dcmutil.h and add it
  named as dcutils.h dcutils.cc to the dcmdata library. Changed
  get function names.  Adapted code using dcutils.

- The put/get-methods for all VRs did not conform to the C++-Standard
  draft. Some Compilers (e.g. SUN-C++ Compiler, Metroworks
  CodeWarrier, etc.) create many warnings concerning the hiding of
  overloaded get methods in all derived classes of DcmElement.
  So the interface of all value representation classes in the
  library are changed rapidly, e.g.
  E_Condition get(Uint16 & value, const unsigned long pos);
  becomes
  E_Condition getUint16(Uint16 & value, const unsigned long pos);
  All (retired) "returntype get(...)" methods are deleted.
