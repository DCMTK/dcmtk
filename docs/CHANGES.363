- Fixed installing OpenSSL DLLs (Windows).
  Affects: dcmnet/apps/CMakeLists.txt

**** Changes from 2018.01.31 (schlamelcher)

- Fixed domain names resolving to unsupported IPv6:
  Fixed domain names accidentally resolving to IPv6 addresses that are
  incompatible with the constructed socket used in the call to connect().
  This caused commands like 'echoscu localhost' to fail on some systems that
  use IPv6 addresses as their default.
  Affects: dcmnet/include/dcmtk/dcmnet/dul.h
           dcmnet/libsrc/dulfsm.cc

- Fixed typo in parameter name.
  Affects: dcmwlm/libsrc/wlfsim.cc

- Removed trailing spaces.
  Affects: dcmtls/docs/certstor.txt

**** Changes from 2018.01.30 (grallert)

- Fixed universal matching of missing values in dcmwlm:
  The matching algorithm in dcmwlm now handles query attributes that are
  semantically equivalent to Universal Matching (as identified by
  DcmElement::isUniversalMatch) as a special case that does not require the
  respective attribute to be present in the candidate data set.
  Affects: dcmwlm/include/dcmtk/dcmwlm/wlfsim.h
           dcmwlm/libsrc/wlfsim.cc

- Introduced DcmElement::isUniversalMatch():
  The function isUniversalMatch() allows to determine whether a QR or Worklist
  query attribute is semantically equivalent to an empty value, e.g. consists
  only of a single wildcard character.

           dcmtls/docs/Makefile.in

- Added documentation on the CA cert management options.
  Added:   dcmtls/docs/certstor.txt

**** Changes from 2018.01.29 (eichelberg)

- Fixed unused variable warning.
  Affects: dcmnet/libsrc/dul.cc

- Fixed bug in poll() related code.
  Affects: dcmnet/libsrc/dul.cc

**** Changes from 2018.01.26 (eichelberg)

- Fixed NULL pointer dereference in dcmqrscp:
  Fixed NULL pointer dereference occuring if a zero byte was present
  in the wrong place in a dcmqrscp configuration file.
  Thanks to GwanYeong Kim <gy741.kim@gmail.com> for the bug report
  and sample dataset.
  Affects: dcmqrdb/libsrc/dcmqrcnf.cc

**** Changes from 2018.01.24 (riesmeier)

- Updated latest tested CMake version:
  Updated information on latest CMake version that has been tested to "3.10.2".
  Affects: CMake/dcmtkPrepare.cmake
           INSTALL

**** Changes from 2018.01.22 (riesmeier)

- Added --extract-xml-single option to findscu:
  Added --extract-xml-single option to findscu and enhanced the underlying C++
  class accordingly. This new option allows for extracting all C-FIND-Response
  datasets of an association to a single XML file. If character set conversion
  is available, all datasets are converted to UTF-8 (in order to avoid issues
  when different character sets are used). See documentation for details.
  Affects: dcmnet/apps/findscu.cc

           dcmnet/include/dcmtk/dcmnet/dfindscu.h
           dcmnet/libsrc/dfindscu.cc

**** Changes from 2018.01.18 (riesmeier)

- Added --extract-xml option to findscu:
  Added --extract-xml option to findscu and enhanced the underlying C++ class
  accordingly. For this reason, the "extractResponses" parameter (no. 13) of
  the DcmFindSCU::performQuery() method has been changed from OFBool to an enum.
  This closes DCMTK Feature #308.

           dcmnet/libsrc/dfindscu.cc

**** Changes from 2018.01.18 (schlamelcher)

- Added a workaround for CMake versions prior 3.x.x:
  Added a workaround for yesterday's commit regarding the unit tests and CMake
  generator expressions. CMake versions prior 3.x.x do not understand $<CONFIG>
  and require using $<CONFIGURATION>, which is in turn deprecated since 3.x.x.
  Good thing this issue was totally not annoying.
  Affects: CMake/dcmtkMacros.cmake
           CMake/dcmtkPrepare.cmake
           CMakeLists.txt

**** Changes from 2018.01.17 (schlamelcher)

- Enhanced the way the unit tests are executed (CMake):
  The unit tests are now added using add_test(NAME ...) instead of the old
  add_test() command. This enables using generator expressions to dynamically
  resolve the location of the test executables.
  Also ensured that the test-exhaustive targets pass $<CONFIG>, which is
  required for setups that use this mechanism (e.g. Visual Studio).
  Closes DCMTK bug #783.

           CMakeLists.txt

**** Changes from 2018.01.15 (eichelberg)

- Now using poll() to handle DICOM network connections:
  On platforms where poll() is available, DCMTK now handles incoming DICOM
  network connections using poll() instead of select(). This is because
  select() is known to crash on Linux when handling more than 1024
  parallel network connections.
  Thanks to Michael Craggs <Michael.Craggs@ith-icoserve.com> for the bug
  report and patch.
  This closes DCMTK bug #798.
  Affects: dcmnet/libsrc/assoc.cc

           dcmnet/libsrc/dulfsm.cc
           dcmtls/libsrc/tlstrans.cc

- Added new autoconf/cmake test for <poll.h>:
  Added a new test in the autoconf and the CMake build that checks if
  <poll.h> is available and treats MacOS X as a special case because
  poll() is broken in several MacOS X versions and should thus not be used.
  Thanks to Michael Craggs <Michael.Craggs@ith-icoserve.com>
  for the suggestion and the CMake implementation.

  Added comment on double use of Defined Term "JAW" for Body Part Examined.
  Affects: dcmsr/libcmr/cid4031e.cc

**** Changes from 2018.01.10 (riesmeier)

- Updated mapping of Body Part Examined to codes:
  Updated mapping of the Defined Terms for Body Part Examined (0018,0015) to
  associated CID 4031 (Common Anatomic Regions) codes based on PS3.16 Table L-1
  (2017e edition of the DICOM standards).
  This closes DCMTK Conformance #794.
  Affects: dcmsr/libcmr/cid4031e.cc

- Added comments, e.g. on what TODO.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcelem.cc

**** Changes from 2018.01.06 (eichelberg)

- Minor changes to avoid warnings on MSVC x64.
  Affects: dcmdata/apps/xml2dcm.cc

- Added parentheses to avoid Clang warning.
  Affects: dcmjpeg/libijg12/jdcoefct.c
           dcmjpeg/libijg16/jdcoefct.c
           dcmjpeg/libijg8/jdcoefct.c

- Added explicit typecast to avoid MSVC warning.
  Affects: dcmnet/tests/tscuscp.cc

**** Changes from 2018.01.05 (riesmeier)

- Added a warning on unused parameter "bitmap-out":
  Report a warning message if the second command line parameter (bitmap-out)
  is specified although option --no-output is used.
  Affects: dcmimage/apps/dcm2pnm.cc

- Enhanced robustness of getUncompressedFrameSize():
  Enhanced robustness and verboseness of getUncompressedFrameSize() method.
  Now, it is checked whether mandatory data elements such as BitsAllocated
  and SamplesPerPixel are present and have a valid value. If not, a warning
  is reported to the logger and a more appropriate condition code is returned.
  This closes DCMTK Feature #587.
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dcelem.h
           dcmdata/libsrc/dcelem.cc

- Output warning for inappropriate element length:
  Output a warning message if the value of the length field is inappropriate
  for the VR when reading a data element from a DICOM dataset, e.g. 2 bytes
  for FL (Floating Point Single).
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcitem.cc

- Fixed output to debug logger.
  Affects: dcmimgle/include/dcmtk/dcmimgle/diinpxt.h

- Fixed various typos in comments and log output.

           dcmdata/tests/tparser.cc

- Double-check length field in print() method:
  Double-check length field for valid value in print() method and output
  "(invalid value)" in case the length is less than the structure size in
  bytes, e.g. 2 for an OF value. This follows the approach introduced with
  the previous commit (for OB/OW values).

           dcmdata/libsrc/dcvrus.cc

- Fixed possible buffer overflow in print() method:
  Fixed possible buffer overflow in DcmOtherByteOtherWord::print() method,
  e.g. when processing an invalid OW value with an element length of 1.
  Thanks to GwanYeong Kim <gy741.kim@gmail.com> for the report and sample
  dataset.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcvrobow.cc

**** Changes from 2017.12.23 (eichelberg)

  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/ofsockad.h

- Minor improvements in class OFSockAddr.
  Affects: ofstd/libsrc/ofsockad.cc

- Minor change to avoid warning on MSVC.
  Affects: oflog/libsrc/tls.cc

**** Changes from 2017.12.22 (schlamelcher)

- Added some '*' to @code sections in Doxygen comments:
  Added some '*' prefixes that had previously been removed as a workaround for a
  bug in some old versions of Doxygen. Newer Doxygen versions reliably parse
  these characters as intended.
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dcjson.h
           dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dcmatch.h

**** Changes from 2017.12.21 (eichelberg)

- Added crypt32 to OpenSSL libraries on Win32:
  Starting with OpenSSL 1.1.0, the Windows crypt32 library is needed for
  a static link of OpenSSL. This library has now been added to the
  CMake OPENSSL_LIBS.
  Thanks to Helmut Steiner for the report and suggestion.
  Affects: CMake/3rdparty.cmake

- Fixed problem with missing inet_ntop() on VS2015:
  Thanks to Sergei Khlutchin for the bug report and fix.
  Affects: ofstd/libsrc/ofsockad.cc

**** Changes from 2017.12.20 (riesmeier)

- Fixed issue with uninitialized memory buffer:
  Fixed an issue with an uninitialized memory buffer when processing
  monochrome DICOM images with invalid data element values in the Image
  Pixel Module. For example, when the value of BitsAllocated was too high,
  parts of the memory buffer that stores the intermediate representation
  of the pixel data did not get initialized (even though it should have
  been "zeroed").
  Thanks to GwanYeong Kim <gy741.kim@gmail.com> for the original report.
  Affects: dcmimgle/include/dcmtk/dcmimgle/dimoipxt.h

**** Changes from 2017.12.20 (schlamelcher)

- Added override DcmPixelItem::calcElementLength():
  DcmPixelItem now overrides DcmElement::calcElementLength(), fixing an issue
  where the Item Tag header was sometimes incorrectly assumed to be 12 bytes
  wide instead of eight.
  Thanks to Peter Klotz <Peter.Klotz@ith-icoserve.com> for the report and his
  assistance with testing the solution.
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dcpxitem.h
           dcmdata/libsrc/dcpxitem.cc

**** Changes from 2017.12.19 (onken)

- Allow serialization of an empty dataset:
  This patch allows the serialization of an empty (e.g.
  default-constructed) DcmDataset object.
  Thanks to Peter Klotz <Peter.Klotz@ith-icoserve.com> for the suggested
  patch.
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dcostrmb.h

**** Changes from 2017.12.15 (riesmeier)

- Reuse pre-computed size of tag header.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcitem.cc

- Added test case "dcmsr_gotoParentUntilRoot":
  Added another test case that checks whether gotoParent() called in a loop
  really sets the cursor to the root node of the tree.
  Affects: dcmsr/tests/tests.cc
           dcmsr/tests/tsrtree.cc

**** Changes from 2017.12.13 (riesmeier)

- Fixed further buffer overruns in writeXML():
  Fixed further possible buffer overruns in writeXML() for VRs with a structure
  size of more than 1 byte. Used the same approach as for "OF" (commit b524e87).
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcvrobow.cc

           dcmdata/libsrc/dcvrof.cc
           dcmdata/libsrc/dcvrol.cc

- Fixed possibly wrong calculation of value count:
  The method getVM() cannot be used for VR classes such as FL, FD and UL to
  determine the number of stored values because derived classes (i.e. OF, OD
  and OL) always return 1 (since this is how the Value Multiplicity is defined
  for these Value Representations). Also enhanced the comment explaining this.

**** Changes from 2017.12.13 (eichelberg)

- Converted tabs to whitespace.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcvrof.cc

- Fixed buffer overrrun in DcmOtherFloat::writeXML():
  Fixed buffer overrun in DcmOtherFloat::writeXML() that occurred if
  an invalid element with VR=OF and Length=2 is present in the dataset
  that is converted to XML.
  Thanks to Gwan Yeong Kim for the bug report.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcvrof.cc

**** Changes from 2017.12.12 (schlamelcher)

- Modified recently introduced OFrvalue_ref_upcast:
  Modified C++11 implementation of OFrvalue_ref_upcast to also work around
  issues with older versions of GCC in addition to being a work around for move
  emulation for pre C++11 compilers.
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/ofutil.h

**** Changes from 2017.12.12 (riesmeier)

- Avoid double definition of WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN:
  Check whether WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN is already defined before defining it in
  a header file. This should avoid compiler warnings on "macro redefinition"
  reported by VisualStudio (Windows) in case this macro is already defined
  somewhere else.
  Thanks to Peter Klotz <Peter.Klotz@ith-icoserve.com> for the report and fix.

           ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/ofmem.h
           ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/ofpwd.h

- Added option --socket-timeout to echoscu:
  Added option --socket-timeout to echoscu (as already done for e.g. storescu).
  Thanks to Michael Craggs <Michael.Craggs@ith-icoserve.com> for the suggested
  patch.
  This partly closed DCMTK Feature #711.
  Affects: dcmnet/apps/Makefile.dep
           dcmnet/apps/echoscu.cc
           dcmnet/docs/echoscu.man

- Use stringstream for dynamic command line options:
  Use the same approach as for other command line tools: use a stringstream
  to prepare the output text of command line options when variable content
  is needed (e.g. for timeouts). For AE titles, the pre-processor macros can
  be used directly within the character string.
  Affects: dcmnet/apps/echoscu.cc

**** Changes from 2017.12.08 (schlamelcher)

- Made OFrvalue_ref_upcast a bit more robust.

- Removed double definition of retired attributes:
  Removed double definition of retired DICOM attributes, i.e. those that can be
  extracted automatically from part 6 and 7 of the DICOM standard are no longer
  added manually at the end of the dictionary file.
  This also fixes the status of Destination AE (2100,0140), which had been
  retired in the past but this retirement has been withdrawn (apparently).

**** Changes from 2017.12.05 (riesmeier)

- Updated "dcmrt" classes based on DICOM 2017e:
  Updated automatically generated IOD and sequence C++ classes for the various
  RT objects based on the current edition of the DICOM standard (2017e).
  Also fixed three attribute definitions that are used in the RT Beams Module
  and that were marked as "retired". This was apparently true some years ago
  but not anymore according to the current edition of the DICOM standard.

- Enforce macro ENABLE_EXTERNAL_DICTIONARY:
  The macro ENABLE_EXTERNAL_DICTIONARY has been configurable via CMake and
  Autoconf but has not been enforced in the code. Conversely, the macro
  DONT_LOAD_EXTERNAL_DICTIONARIES existed which has been used in the code but
  has not been configurable via CMake or Autoconf.
  This commit enforces ENABLE_EXTERNAL_DICTIONARY, while
  DONT_LOAD_EXTERNAL_DICTIONARIES is made deprecated leading to an error
  when used in the build.

- Refactored/Fixed (Ident.) Pixel Value Transf. FG:
  Refactored and fixed the (Identity) Pixel Value Transformation Functional
  Group. The Identity version of the Functional Group sets fixed values for
  Rescale Slope/Intercept/Type, and thus is a specialization of the regular
  Pixel Value Transformation Functional Group. In order to use the existing
  Identity version for both type of FGs, the code for the Identity version
  has been generalized.
  The original trigger for the fix was that it was undecidable for the FG
  factory code to decide by the FG sequence tag which of both FGs to
  instantiate (reflected by a faulty doubled if condition). Also, the file
  has been renamed, so that name the reflects the more general Pixel Value
  Transformation FG.
  Fixed misleading code indentation reported by gcc.
  Thanks to Martin Strunz for the report.

- Fixed SCU/SCP test under 32 Bit Windows:
  Fixed failing SCU/SCP test under 32 Bit Windows. However, the underyling
  problem was more generic: The OFStandard::sleep() method and the methods
  internally called on the different operating systems are not necessarily
  sleeping the desired number of seconds but can return earlier, since
  various signals or events (in this case: a connection timeout on the
  network) can force sleep() to return earlier. The test has been fixed by
  using a method that ensures sleep() sleeps at least for the desired time.
  Further small test enhancements and documentation.
  This fixes bug #789.

- Fixed CMake warning caused by CMP0005:
  Fixed CMake warning caused by CMake policy CMP0005, that DCMTK uses to
  enforce old CMake behaviour, in order to escape DCMTK's build date
  string (DCMTK_BUILD_DATE). The policy rule has been moved to the place
  where it is needed. DCMTK does not make use of escaping in
  ADD_DEFINITION statements anywhere else, so this should be safe.

- Enhanced documentation:
  Make sure that the term "host name" is only used if the actual name is
  meant, not the IP. Otherwise, if IP should be included, the term "host"
  is used. Also replaced occurrences of "hostname" with "host name".

- Make sure the calling host is being checked:
  DcmSCP has a virtual method in order to check whether the calling host
  should be accepted or not, so that derived classes could implement their
  own acceptance policy for hosts. However, it turned out that this method
  has not been called at all so far. Now the host is checked when
  connecting.

- Better error reporting for bad SCP configurations:
  DcmSCP does now print better error messages in case the user forgot to
  specify presentation contexts, or does provide invalid presentation
  contexts. Also, a dedicated error code was introduced for those cases.

- Option enabling Verification on base class SCP:
  An option was added to add Verification SOP Class support on the base

  not support any SOP Class at all in order to give the user full control

  Also, added related test and fixed some typos.

  All modules in DCMTK now use OFStandard::getAddressByHostname() (which is
  "IPv6 safe" instead of the older OFStandard::getHostByName() method,
  which has been removed together with the OFStandard::OFHostent helper class.
  This closes DCMTK bug #714.

**** Changes from 2017.11.16 (schlamelcher)

- Introduced DcmTLSOptions and related error conditions:
  Introduced DcmTLSOptions, a class for managing the command line options that
  control the behavior of DCMTLS. DcmTLSOptions handles storing the relevant
  options, printing the associated help text an information (e.g. OpenSSL
  library version), parsing and evaluating the given command line arguments and
  creating a DcmTLSTransportLayer object based on the collected information.
  Furthermore the new file tlscond.h has been added, declaring error conditions
  for the things that might go wrong within DcmTLSOptions instead of simply
  printing whatever message via OFLog directly.
  Added:   dcmtls/include/dcmtk/dcmtls/tlscond.h

  Affects: dcmtls/libsrc/CMakeLists.txt
           dcmtls/libsrc/Makefile.in

- Refactored DcmTransportLayer and DcmTLSTransportLayer:
  Enhanced ownership semantics and consistency of DcmTransportLayer and
  DcmTLSTransportLayer.
  - Both classes can now be default constructed, e.g. to create a placeholder
    object on the stack and avoid creating the object on the heap via 'new'.
  - Both objects now support move semantics to transfer the ownership of any
    used resources, e.g. for being able to setup a transport layer in a
    easy to use method that passes the created object as return value.
  - DcmTLSTransportLayer now uses its base DcmTransportLayer to create a
    connection if no encrypted connection was requested - removes duplicated
    "copy and paste" code.

  OFvariant.
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/ofvriant.h
           ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/variadic/variant.h

**** Changes from 2017.11.15 (eichelberg)

- Use getnameinfo() for reverse DNS lookups:
  Added a new function OFStandard::getHostnameByAddress() that performs
  a reverse DNS lookup of a hostname based on an IP address. This function
  uses the protocol independent getnameinfo(3) function if available instead
  of gethostbyname() or gethostbyname_r().
  Removed function OFStandard::getHostByAddr(), which due to its interface
  cannot be ported to use getnameinfo(3) and which is not used anymore
  in the toolkit.
  This closes DCMTK bug #715.

- Fixed return type for _findfirst():
  Fixed variable type for storing the result of _findfirst(),
  which caused problems on 64-bit Windows builds.
  This closes DCMTK bug #802.
  Affects: dcmwlm/libsrc/wlfsim.cc

**** Changes from 2017.11.02 (riesmeier)

- Consistently use Command Priority "MEDIUM":
  Consistently use the default value "MEDIUM" (0x00) for Priority (0000,0700)
  in all DIMSE request messages, i.e. for C-STORE, C-FIND, C-GET and C-MOVE.
  Before, some network tools and also the DcmSCU class used "LOW" (0x02) for
  unknown reasons.
  The Priority value is still "hard coded" (i.e. not configurable) since we
  are not aware of any DICOM implementation that would make a difference on
  the value of (0000,0700).

- Avoid possible 32-bit unsigned integer overflow:
  Avoid possible 32-bit unsigned integer overflow when computing the values
  of the Basic Offset Table (by using the helper OFStandard::safeAdd()).
  This closes DCMTK Bug #797.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcpxitem.cc

- Enhanced documentation of createOffsetTable():
  Enhanced documentation of parameter "offsetList" in method createOffsetTable()
  of class DcmPixelItem.
  This partly closes DCMTK Bug #797.
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dcpxitem.h

- Added short section on "DICOM Data Dictionary":
  Added a short section on the "DICOM Data Dictionary" explaining the
  different defaults on Unix and Windows systems. Further details can
  be found in the corresponding documentation file ("datadict.txt").
  Affects: INSTALL

**** Changes from 2017.10.26 (eichelberg)

- Enabled new TLS versions when using OpenSSL < 1.1.0:
  When compiling DCMTK with OpenSSL versions older than 1.1.0, we now use the
  SSLv23 client and server methods instead of the TLSv1 methods because the
  latter only accept TLS 1.0 connections and prevent the negotiation of newer
  TLS versions. We use SSL_CTX_set_options() to disable SSLv2 and SSLv3.
  Thanks to Peter Klotz <Peter.Klotz@ith-icoserve.com> for the suggested patch.
  This closes DCMTK Feature #790.
  Affects: dcmtls/libsrc/tlslayer.cc

- Refactored install using GNUInstallDirs CMake Module:
  The installation directory structure controlling variables (DCMTK_INSTALL_XXX)
  have been replaced by the ones defined by including the GNUInstallDirs CMake
  module, in general:
    DCMTK_INSTALL_XXXXXX -> CMAKE_INSTALL_XXXXXX
  Some exceptions were necessary, namingly:
    DCMTK_INSTALL_INCDIR -> CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR
    DCMTK_INSTALL_ETCDIR -> CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSCONFDIR
    DCMTK_INSTALL_DATDIR -> CMAKE_INSTALL_DATADIR
    DCMTK_INSTALL_HTMDIR -> removed, controlled by CMAKE_INSTALL_DOCDIR
    DCMTK_INSTALL_CMKDIR -> removed from cache, automatically set based
                            on CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR (Unix) or set to
                            'cmake' (Windows)
  Furthermore, the semantics of the following variables differ slightly:
    CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR -> now automatically 'lib' or 'lib64' as appropriate
    CMAKE_INSTALL_DATADIR -> not containing the 'dcmtk' part of the path
    CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSCONFDIR -> not containing the 'dcmtk' part of the path
  The minimum required CMake version has been increased 2.8.3 -> 2.8.5 since
  GNUInstallDirs is only available in CMake >= 2.8.5.

- Removed superfluous CMake policy setting:
  Removed superfluous CMake policy setting that was needed for CMake 2.6.
  However, now that DCMTK requires at least CMake 2.8.3, the policy is set
  in any case automatically.
  Also removed superfluous minimum CMake version 2.6 in dcmtkPrepare.cmake,
  since the CMake minimum version is already set to 2.8.3 in
  CMakeLists.txt root file.

- Further enhanced iterating an SR document tree:
  Further enhanced iterating an SR document tree. First of all, the tree node
  cursor classes DSRDocumentTreeNodeCursor and DSRIncludedTemplateNodeCursor
  are now derived explicitly from the template base class in order to allow
  extending their capabilities more individually. Then, a new filter mechanism
  has been introduced that allows for matching document tree nodes based on a
  variety of properties like value type and concept name. These filters can
  even be combined using boolean operators like AND and OR. Finally, added
  new methods getCursorToCurrentNode() and getCursorToSubTree() to the base
  class for SR document trees (DSRDocumentSubTree).

- Fixed CMake tests for isnan() and isinf():
  Fixed CMake tests for isnan() and isinf() that have been failing on some
  systems if C++11 was enabled for the build.
  Thanks to Max Smolens (github user msmolens) for the report and patch.
  Affects: CMake/GenerateDCMTKConfigure.cmake

- Fixed bug when importing Series and Frame of Ref:
  Fixed bug when importing Series and Frame of Reference, caused by a
  wrong "forwarding" import() call that used the parameters in the wrong
  order. This behaviour was hidden by another issue where the same
  parameters have been switched around (compared to the header) in the
  calling method's parameter list. When the latter issue was fixed
  earlier (see commit a9b866) the former issue got revealed, leading to
  problems when both parameters (readSeries and readFoR) were called with
  different values.
  This commit fixes the order in the import() call, and makes the
  parameter order in all import() methods consistent.
  CAUTION: In order to make the user aware of the critical parameter order
  change, the name of the import() method is now importHierarchy() and a
  prominent note was added that the orders of parmeters is incompatible
  to the old one.

**** Changes from 2017.08.22 (riesmeier)

- Renamed method addImageEntryDescriptors():
  Renamed method addImageEntryDescriptors() in class TID1600_ImageLibrary to
  addImageGroupDescriptors(), which is more descriptive, i.e. better explains
  what this method does. Also renamed an error condition constant in order to
  be consistent with the new name. Renaming should be OK since this class is
  still pretty new and has probably a limited number of users (outside QIICR).

           dcmsr/tests/tsrcmr.cc

- Enhanced support for descriptors (TID 1600):
  Enhanced support for image entry descriptors by adding two new "modes": one
  allows for adding selected descriptors only (from a given list) and the other
  allows for adding all but the selected descriptors (also from a given list).
  These two new modes enable the user of class TID1600_ImageLibrary to decide
  which descriptors are added on group level and which ones on image level.
  See test case "dcmsr_TID1600_ImageLibrary" for an example on how to use it.
  Also removed the not very intuitive default values for the "mode" parameter
  from addImageEntry() and addImageEntryDescriptors(), i.e. now the "add mode"
  always has to be specified explicitly. Your compiler will tell you about this
  change.

- Add extra content items to extensible templates:
  Added new method that allows for adding extra content items to extensible
  SR templates. Also added new test case and enhanced existing ones to verify
  that it works as expected.
  Renamed existing method insertTemplate() to insertExtraTemplate() in order
  to be consistent with the new method addExtraContentItem(). This method was
  only used in two test cases so far.

- Added mode for order of content items significant:
  Added new mode to base class of all SR Templates specifying whether the order
  of content items is significant or not. This mode is set by all classes that
  are currently implemented from the DICOM Content Mapping Resource (DCMR).
  However, this mode is not yet checked since the implemented classes handle
  the order significance internally.

- Created new class for TID 1419 (Measurement):
  Created new class for TID 1419 ("Measurement" content item and its children)
  by extracting the previously built-in support from the class for TID 1411.
  This allows for supporting more content items from TID 1419, e.g. the
  "Modifier" and the "Derivation Parameter". Also added support for the
  "Qualitative Evaluations" contents items to TID 1411, and added new test
  case for the new class.
  Please note that the API for adding Measurements to TID 1411 changed
  regarding the optional parameters "method" and "derivation".
