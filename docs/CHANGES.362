**** Changes from 2017.07.13 (schlamelcher)

- Made including third-party libraries version agnostic:
  Made the Windows specific CMake code for including third party libraries
  version agnostic, i.e. it now searches for "libtiff*" instead of
  "libtiff-<hardcoded version number>".
  Affects: CMake/3rdparty.cmake

**** Changes from 2017.07.12 (schlamelcher)

- Added support for suppressing C4307 on Visual Studio:
  Added support for suppressing integer overflow warnings emitted by Visual
  Studio, currently used to suppress this warning in the OFnumeric_limits unit
  test where the integer overflow behavior is being tested.
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/diag/overflow.def

- Removed several macros from config/docs/macros.txt:
  Removed the description of several macros from config/docs/macros.txt since
  they are now controlled by Autoconf/CMake and should no longer be modified by
  the user directly.
  Affects: config/docs/macros.txt

- Removed no longer required section from COPYRIGHT:
  Removed no longer required section about the Android toolchain configuration
  file from COPYRIGHT since the reference file has been removed from DCMTK.
  Affects: COPYRIGHT

**** Changes from 2017.07.12 (onken)

- Export new LFS CMake flag to DCMTKConfig.cmake:
  Export the recently introduced LFS CMake flag to DCMTKConfig.cmake (for
  current CMake version and legacy versions > 2.8.3).
  Affects: CMake/DCMTKConfig.cmake.in

**** Changes from 2017.07.11 (schlamelcher)

- Added a workaround for inconsistent LFS API under QNX.
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/offile.h

- More fixes for SunPro:
  Modified the configuration test for readdir_r to also check the number of
  arguments and their types. This broke overnight for an unknown reason.
  Silenced some warnings about overloaded methods being hidden in derived
  classes.

- Small fixes for a previous commit:
  Fixed a typo and removed an inappropriate restriction (only affecting the
  CMake GUI):
  DCMTK_ENABLE_LFS was falsely restricted to the modes that were detected as
  available, making it impossible to choose 'lfs' in case 'lfs64' was available
  (since in that case the test looking for 'lfs' was not run and it was
  therefore unknown whether it is available or not). Now it is also possible to
  choose modes where the configuration tests have not been executed yet to
  trigger launching the tests in the first place.
  Affects: CMake/GenerateDCMTKConfigure.cmake

- Workaround for strange LFS implementation on Windows:
  Windows (Visual Studio) provides a strange implicit LFS implementation where
  fpos_t is a 64 bit type but off_t is 32 bit.
  This implementation is now detected via configuration tests (CMake, not
  relevant for Autoconf since it is Windows only) and then honored by ignoring
  off_t and using Sint64 instead. This replaces the '#ifdef _WIN32' hacks
  removed by a previous commit hoping the already introduced configuration tests
  made them obsolete (which should now finally be the case).

           ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/offile.h

**** Changes from 2017.07.10 (schlamelcher)

- Added DCMTK_ENABLE_LFS for choosing LFS type (CMake):
  Added CMake variable for choosing the LFS type (lfs64/lfs/auto/off). This
  implementation is now similar to the Autoconf one (--enable-lfs=).
  Also modified the resulting macro in 'osconfig.h' to explicitly select the
  implementation, similar to DCMTK_ENABLE_CHARSET_CONVERSION. OFFile will now
  use EXPLICIT_LFS64 in case DCMTK_ENABLE_LFS is set to DCMTK_LFS64 and call
  the normal file access functions otherwise.
  The only difference between setting DCMTK_ENABLE_LFS to 'lfs' and 'off' is
  that setting it to 'off' will not set the required compiler flags and
  preprocessor definitions (if any) i.e. it is not possible forcibly disable LFS
  in case it is implicitly provided without setting any flags and/or
  preprocessor definitions.

           ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/offile.h

- Added a workaround for C++11 compiling errors:
  Added a workaround for errors when enabling C++11 (DCMTK_ENABLE_CXX11) without
  enabling std::tuple. It is of course debatable whether this scenario makes any
  sense at all, but since it is currently the default behavior this workaround
  should increase usability.
  We should possible override the user choice whether or not to enable
  std::tuple in case C++11 was enabled in the future or provide a full C++11
  implementation of OFtuple (is there any C++11 compiler that does not have
  std::tuple?).
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/variadic/tuple.h

**** Changes from 2017.07.07 (schlamelcher)

- Silenced output of FIND_PACKAGE(ICU):
  Silenced the output of FIND_PACKAGE(ICU) to be consistent with the other
  occurrences of FIND_PACKAGE() within the CMake configuration.
  Affects: CMake/3rdparty.cmake

- Fixed wrong usage of alignas:
  Fixed using alignas within typedefs (which was first introduced to realize
  compatibility with the implementation for Visual Studio). The new
  implementations of OFalign and OFalign_typename for alignas only define the
  given type without the alignment (for handling arrays) and add the alignment
  modifier on preprocessor level.
  Adjusted the documentation of OFalign accordingly and removed the now
  unnecessary configuration test whether type definitions using alignas are
  possible (since even if the test succeeded the compilers most likely didn't
  actually align the resulting type as one would expect).
  Thanks to Stefan Hengelein and Peter Klotz for reporting the issue.

**** Changes from 2017.07.06 (schlamelcher)

- Fixed unexpected iconv behavior on FreeBSD:
  The iconv implementation inside FreeBSD's C standard library shows custom
  behavior when illegal character sequences are encountered (replacing them
  with '?' instead of failing the conversion). OFCharacterEncoding now correctly
  describes this behavior as unknown and does not longer claim that it supports
  the mode 'AbortTranscodingOnIllegalSequence'.
  Affects: ofstd/libsrc/ofchrenc.cc

**** Changes from 2017.07.05 (schlamelcher)

- Fixed compiling with Oracle Developer Studio (SunPro):
  Fixed linker issues caused by missing 'const' modifiers on some by-value
  arguments. The compiler seems to understand that these functions are
  compatible but then creates symbol references to the spelling that doesn't
  exist, leading to linker errors later in the build process.
  Removed some of the previously introduced workarounds that are not necessary
  on newer versions of SunPro, the old versions that required them lack some
  fundamental C++ features that are necessary for building DCMTK anyway (also
  removing the comment that SunPro was the retarded child of a Java compiler and
  an actual C++ compiler that is no longer true - SunPro can no longer be
  considered a child). Use Oracle Developer Studio 12.5 or later!

- Fixed compiler errors on Visual Studio with OpenSSL:
  Fixed compiling dcmtls with Visual Studio and OpenSSL 1.1.0f by:
  - Ensuring that OpenSSL headers can be included when performing the
    configuration tests, even when they are no in the system include
    directories.
  - Linking to the correct library (dcmtkeay was renamed to dcmtkcrypto).
  - Fixing related code in dcmtls (added missing include and fixed
    SOCKET -> DcmNativeSocketType).

- Fixed typo in Coding Scheme Description.
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/codes/srt.h

**** Changes from 2017.07.03 (schlamelcher)

- Many workarounds for SunPro:
  Many workarounds and some actually meaningful fixes for the SunPro compiler.
  In general the compiler at best seems to have a basic implementation of
  some parts of the C++ type system but does not actually implement it, e.g.
  fails to understand more complex types and perform any meaningful operations
  on them.
  The (perhaps) meaningful fixes are:
  1. The configuration test for detecting whether the compiler is able to
  identify default constructable classes via SFINAE now also tests whether the
  result is the expected one and not only whether the code compiles.
  2. The configuration tests for std::list and std::vector now also tests
  whether a const_iterator can be compared to a mutable iterator of the
  respective template, e.g. whether the compiler understands that a
  const_iterator can be constructed out of an iterator for the comparison on the
  fly.
  3. The configuration tests for 'getgrnam_r' and 'getpwnam_r' now also ensure
  that both functions take the expected number (and types) of arguments.

**** Changes from 2017.07.03 (onken)

- Moved TRY_COMPILE to where it is first needed:
  Moved TRY_COMPILE macro inclusion to the position where it is
  first needed since otherwise CMake Version 2.8.3 will generate
  an error when trying to run cmake in an existing build tree again.
  Affects: CMake/GenerateDCMTKConfigure.cmake

- Require CMake > 2.8.3. Extended DCMTKConfig.cmake:
  The minimum CMake version required to build DCMTK was forwarded to
  2.8.3. since at least the FindICU.cmake script needs this version.
  The minimum required version used before (2.6) has been broken also for
  other other reasons (unsupported CACHE target for SET_PROPERTY and
  problems with some syntax constructs which could probably be solved).
  Also, more build parameters are now being exported to DCMTKConfig.cmake
  which now better reflect the current build configuration switches used
  when building DCMTK.
  The version DCMTKConfig.cmake26.in has been renamed to
  CMake/DCMTKConfig.old_cmake.in in order to reflect the new minimum version.
  Note that it is now only used for all CMake versions betweeen 2.8.3 (new
  minimum) and 2.8.8 (exclusively), since the latter includes the features required
  to use the "modern" DCMTKConfig.cmake.
  Added:   CMake/DCMTKConfig.old_cmake.in
  Removed: CMake/DCMTKConfig.cmake26.in
  Affects: CMake/DCMTKConfig.cmake.in
           CMakeLists.txt

**** Changes from 2017.07.01 (schlamelcher)

- Fixed wrong syntax in previous commit.
  Affects: CMake/GenerateDCMTKConfigure.cmake

- Workaround for SunPro C vs. C++ inconsistencies:
  The SunPro C compiler provides __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ et al. whereas its C++
  version doesn't. Added configuration tests to ensure these macros are
  available for C and C++ before enabling them in the code (via 'osconfig.h').
  Affects: CMake/GenerateDCMTKConfigure.cmake

- Fixed configuration test errors:
  Fixed configuration test errors on Unix like systems introduced by the
  previous commit that fixed them on Visual Studio.
  Affects: CMake/GenerateDCMTKConfigure.cmake

**** Changes from 2017.07.01 (grallert)

- Fixed configuration test errors on Visual Studio:
  Fixed inappropriate use of CHECK_FUNCTION_EXISTS() for detecting 'memcmp',
  'memcpy' and 'memset', which became apparent by the recent modification that
  changed the configuration tests to be run in 'Release' mode.
  As described by the CMake documentation, CHECK_FUNCTION_EXISTS() cannot be
  used to detect functions that are inlined in headers or specified as a macro
  and fails to detect anything in the 32-bit versions of the Win32 API, because
  of a mismatch in calling conventions.
  Affects: CMake/GenerateDCMTKConfigure.cmake

**** Changes from 2017.06.30 (schlamelcher)

- Several fixes for the SunPro compiler (Solaris):
  Added some missing includes to 'arith.cc' and a special compiler flag to
  CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS and CMAKE_C_FLAGS.
  Affects: CMake/dcmtkPrepare.cmake
           config/tests/arith.cc

**** Changes from 2017.06.30 (schlamelcher)

- Fixed using wrong build type for configuration test:
  CMake will now use the same build configuration for running the unit tests
  (e.g. 'Release' or 'Debug') as the one that was chosen for building DCMTK.
  This fixes different configuration results incompatible with the later build,
  e.g. not detecting the problems with Visual Studio 2005's STL vector that
  led to failing the OFVector unit test.
  Affects: CMake/GenerateDCMTKConfigure.cmake

**** Changes from 2017.06.30 (grallert)

- Modified compiler Flags for Solaris (CMake):
  The compiler flags for Solaris will now be auto-detected by CMake instead of
  setting them manually. This fixes problems with clang.
  Affects: CMake/dcmtkPrepare.cmake

- Added missing compiler flags for NetBSD (Autoconf).
  Affects: config/configure
           config/configure.in

**** Changes from 2017.06.29 (schlamelcher)

- Removed broken attributes from dcmqrdb:
  Removed incomplete implementation of the special Query Retrieve attributes
  'Number of Patient Related Studies', 'Number of Patient Related Series',
  'Number of Patient Related Instances', 'Number of Study Related Series' and

  Added a workaround for buggy code generated by GCC for x87 FPUs.
  Affects: ofstd/libsrc/oftime.cc

**** Changes from 2017.06.23 (riesmeier)

- Removed 2nd parameter from gotoNamedChildNode():
  Removed optional second parameter "searchIntoSub" from gotoNamedChildNode()
  since using a value of "OFTrue" (which was also the default) makes no sense
  and resulted in unexpected behavior. Now, only the first sub-level is checked
  for matching child nodes. Also enhanced recently added test cases.

- Added new method gotoNamedNodeInSubTree():
  Added new method that allows for setting the cursor to a named node in the
  subtree below the current node. This method complements the existing method
  gotoNamedChildNode().

- Several fixes for NetBSD support:
  Added required compiler flags and ensured linking the required libraries.
  Implemented additional configuration tests for gethostbyname_r and
  gethostbyaddr_r. Fixed CMakeLists.txt in dcmpstat/apps because it links
  unnecessary libraries to dcmmkcrv and dcmmklut which result in an error.

  Added recently approved Storage SOP classes also to the "Storage SCU" and
  "Role Selection" sections, but only as comments since the maximum number of
  presentation contexts has already been reached.
  Affects: dcmqrdb/etc/dcmqrprf.cfg

- Added definition of new Presentation States:
  Added new Presentation State SOP Classes (from Supplement 189 and 190) to
  the list of known Presentation State (PR) types, i.e. accept them in an SR
  document where a PR object is expected, and associate a human readable name
  with them.
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrtypes.h

  Added initial support for the new "Patient Radiation Dose SR" Storage
  SOP Class (Supplement 191), i.e. this new SR document type is now known
  to the "dcmsr" module but now yet fully supported. In particular, the
  corresponding "IOD Constraint Checker" still has to be implemented.

- Updated data dictionary for DICOM 2017b:
  Updated data dictionary for the latest edition of the DICOM standard, which
  has been released only recently.
  Since three DICOM attributes were "retired", the name of the associated
  DcmTagKey constants also changed. This required minor changes to the source
  code, especially with regards to the attribute Other Patient IDs (0010,1000):
  the name changed from DCM_OtherPatientIDs to DCM_RETIRED_OtherPatientIDs.

- Fixed issue with configure test on QNX 6.5:
  Fixed issue with configure test for the macro INCLUDE_LIBC_H_AS_EXTERN_C,
  which used to work on QNX 6.2 but does not work anymore on QNX 6.5. This
  test should have no meaning for any other platform / operating system.

  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/offile.h

- Changed the way XMLLIBS is set (Autoconf):
  Changed the way XMLLIBS is set when using Autoconf. Now, the value returned
  by "xml2-config --libs" is used, which might include the library path (i.e.
  something like "-L/usr/local/lib").
  This change was needed for supporting QNX 6.5 but, of course, it should also
  work on other systems.

- Added a partial workaround for DCMTK bug #758:
  Added a check to the configuration and unit tests of std::vector/OFVector to
  ensure that the construction of recursive data structures based on OFVector
  does not cause a stack overflow.
  Modified the default constructor of DCMTK's OFVector implementation to no
  longer predictively construct some elements, such that it passes the new test.

  Affects: dcmnet/tests/tscuscp.cc

- Test recently introduced role selection option:
  Test the recently introduced role selection compatibility option for
  accepting Default role even if SCP role is configured for the
  association acceptor.
  Affects: dcmnet/tests/tscuscp.cc

- Opt. accept Default role if SCP role expected:
  Added option to dcmnet assocation acceptor code that allows to accept
  a Default role (no role selection in request) even if the acceptor is
  configured to only accept SCP role. This is helpful for faulty clients
  in services like Storage Commitment or Retrieve (via C-GET) very
  association requestors have to use role selection if they want to be
  correct with respect to the standard. Sine some are not, this option
  makes sure that such requests can be accepted (with return Default role,
  too).

- Removed dcmStrictRoleSelection config. switch:

  same behaviour by already configuring the proposed roles accordingly.
  Affects: dcmnet/include/dcmtk/dcmnet/dul.h
           dcmnet/libsrc/assoc.cc

- Fixed possible role selection config. problem:
  Fixed possible role selection problem for association acceptors. If the
  first presentation context added to the association configuration used a
  default role, any other presentation context with role selection
  configured would not configure correctly. The reason is that when
  creating the underlying association profile in the first step, one
  already has to know the role selection profile, which does not exist if
  not instantly added together with the association configuration profile
  (together with the first presentation context). This commit ensures that
  an empty role selection profile can and is created in any case and all
  presentation contexts with role selection being added refer to that profile.

- Fixed wrong copy of SOP class in role selection:
  Fixed copying of SOP class in role selection code which could lead to
  shortened SOP Class UIDs in role selection items and thus to
  presentation contexts not being marked with the correct role.
  Affects: dcmnet/libsrc/dulparse.cc

**** Changes from 2017.06.06 (goldhammer)

  implementation from the DcmElement class hierarchy.
  Affects: dcmwlm/include/dcmtk/dcmwlm/wlfsim.h

- Fixed combined date time range matching:
  Fixed a bug in the combined date time (range) matching implementation in
  DcmAttributeMatching.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcmatch.cc

- Added attribute matching functions to DcmElement etc:
  Added methods to perform the appropriate kind of attribute matching on an
  instance of one of the DcmElement and derived classes: matches() and
  combinationMatches(), the latter being used for combined date time (range)
  matching.
  Calling match() will check that both the left hand DcmElement object and
  the one provided as its argument are compatible (e.g. similar VR) and then
  return the results from the appropriate matching function from
  DcmAttributeMatching (Wildcard Matching, Range Matching, etc.).

- Added association negotiation profiles to dcmqrscp:
  Added support for association negotiation profiles via configuration file
  to dcmqrscp. The configuration file may be used to propose and accept
  additional storage SOP Classes as required for both incoming and outgoing
  associations separately.
  Accepting non storage SOP Class presentation contexts is not affected by the

- Several fixes for Solaris support:
  Added required compiler flags and libraries (CMake, Autoconf seemingly already

  ones Autoconf has.
  Fixed 'arith.cc': Solaris seemed to reset the signal handlers after every
  processed signal, they are now always re-enabled as a workaround for that.

- Updated copyright notice in recently modified file.

- Fixed some code relying on C++11 features:
  The recently introduced configuration tests for several STL features allowed
  using certain classes like std::tuple and std::error_code that were previously
  only enabled if C++11 support was enabled.
  The affected code was refactored to not depend on C++11 features any more
  (if possible) or wrapped behind #ifdef HAVE_CXX11 with an added fall-back
  implementation (hybrid between the existing fall-back implementation and using

- Enhanced recently introduced STL configuration tests:
  The configuration tests for std::list and std::vector now also ensure that
  calling x.swap(y) does not invalidate any existing iterators (except for the
  ones referring to past-the-end) as required by the C++ standard and DCMTK.
  The configuration test for std::tuple now also ensures that std::tuple
  can take at least 50 template parameters (same as DCMTK's fall-back
  implementation) since otherwise DCMTK's fall-back implementation can be
  considered more mature.

**** Changes from 2017.05.16 (schlamelcher)

- Added configuration options for STL and C++11:
  Added configuration options for enabling STL and C++11 features for Autoconf
  and CMake. Enabling the STL will by default enable all separate STL classes
  (std::vector etc.) and functions, unless the respective switches are
  set individually. One may also enable only a single STL feature (e.g.
  std::string) without enabling all of the STL classes. Not all possible
  combinations may work though!
  C++11 support can either be enabled or disabled entirely, enabling individual
  C++11 features while disabling others is currently not supported (and probably
  never will be).
  Enabling an STL feature or C++11 will not directly set the respective MACRO
  (e.g. HAVE_STL_STRING), instead a configuration test will be performed to
  determine if the compiler provides an implementation that is sufficiently
  close enough to the C++ standard for DCMTK's requirements. If not, the feature
  will not be enabled!
  Enhanced the documentation in config/docs/macros.txt and config/docs/cxx11.dox
  appropriately for these changes.
  Tested several plausible combinations auf enabled/disabled STL and C++11
  features and fixed the affected code as required.

**** Changes from 2017.05.05 (onken)

- Added OB/OW-related comparison operators:
  Added comparsion() method to all OB/OW-based classes that usually deal
  with pixel data. So far, elements instantiated into such classes used
  the inherited compare() method from DcmElement and thus also returned
  equality if only tag and (E)VR have been identical, without even looking
  into the values.
  The new method uses the DcmElement check, and then compares the values
  in a meaningful way.
  For compressed data, equality is only returned if both elements do have
  native pixel data which is identical, or the have same current
  representation (compressed pixel data), i.e. the same transfer syntax,
  the same number of pixel items, with the same values (compared bytewise).
  If both elements do have the same representations (besides others) but
  those are not the current ones, the comparison will not return equality.
  Extended test for all data types (VRs) now offering the compare() method.
  This closes DCMTK Bug #674.

- First check number of components before value:
  compare() was changed to first check the number of values of an element
  instead of first comparing the values. The reason is that it takes
  significantly more effort to compare the values which is often not
  necessary if the number of components is different anyway. This is
  especially useful for large binary values (like pixel data). The
  following commit will introduced specific comparsion operators for such
  elements.
  This might result in calls to compare() that now return -1 that earlier
  returned 1, and vice versa. This is not considered harmful since the
  functionality is quite new in DCMTK, and the majority of use cases would
  only check whether two elements are equal (0 returned) or not. The new
  implementation will never return equality (0) where it earlier returned
  -1 or 1.

- Converting large attributes to UN in explicit VR:
  When writing in explicit VR, some VRs are encoded with a 2-byte length field,
  whereas other VRs are encoded with a 4-byte length field. When writing
  implicit VR, all length fields are always encoded with 4 bytes. In some
  cases attribute values of the affected VRs may be larger than 64 kBytes,
  in which case the dataset can be represented in implicit VR, but not in
  explicit VR. Instead of refusing to write such datasets in explicit VR,
  DCMTK now automatically converts the affected attributes to UN
  (or, when generation of post-1993 VRs is disabled, to OB).
  This implements DICOM CP 1066 and closes DCMTK issue #331.

- Partially refactored 'errno' usage within dcmnet:
  Added specialized error code handling for WinSock by using
  OFStandard::getLastNetworkErrorCode() and the respective WinSock error
  constants (WSAEINTR) as appropriate within dulfsm.cc.
  Most of the other files in dcmnet and the rest of DCMTK already have a
  separate Windows implementation in this regard, so this fixes most of the
  remaining problems.

- Replaced 'errno' with OFStandard::getLast*ErrorCode():
  Replaced occurrences of 'errno' with the appropriate call to one of the
  recently introduced methods OFStandard::getLastSystemErrorCode() and

  This refactoring should ensure that DCMTK always uses the right source for
  printing operating system error codes, preventing inappropriate error messages
  like "error: no error".

- Fixed CMake check for <png.h> resp. <libpng/png.h>:
  CMake now honors the zlib and libpng include directories while searching for
  <png.h> and <libpng/png.h>. This fixes detecting these files when they are not
  in the default include paths (e.g. on Windows).
  Including <png.h> is preferred, therefore, <libpng/png.h> is not searched for
  if <png.h> exists. The old CMake code simply did not define HAVE_LIBPNG_PNG_H
  no matter what, now, it is used as a fallback mechanism if <png.h> is
  unavailable.

- Added some CMake config tests and removed a macro:
  Added tests for std::nothrow new/delete and the std namespace itself. These
  have previously been fixed constants in the CMake configuration.
  Removed macro NO_IOS_BASE_ASSIGN, since copy assignment of std::iostreams is
  generally a bad idea. The affected code was modified to always operate without
  assigning iostreams to another (perhaps assigning the underlying streambuffers
  would be what the author originally intended, but the code should have been
  dead without anybody noticing it for quite some time now anyway, so removing
  it should be safe).

- Introduced OFerror_code and related functionalities:
  Introduced OFerror_code, OFerror_category and the functions
  OFsystem_category() and OFgeneric_category() as portable implementations of
  C++11's std::error_code etc.
  Implemented the custom functions OFStandard::getLastSystemErrorCode() and
  OFStandard::getLastNetworkErrorCode() that return an OFerror_code object
  referring to the most recent error (using errno, GetLastError() or
  WSAGetLastError() as appropriate).
  The returned object can then be used to log the error message in a portable
  fashion, since the linked OFsystem_category() ensures the use of strerror,
  strerror_r or FormatMessage() as required by the target platform.

- Refactored getMACAddress() and its use:
  The recently modified getMACAddress() function now uses OFVector for
  allocating and freeing the buffer memory and has been changed to return not
  only the MAC address of the first adapter but instead the MAC addresses of all
  adapters. The function has therefore been renamed to getMACAddresses().
  The calling code now adds all available MAC addresses to the CRC hash for
  generating a UUID.
  Also, a warning message output has been added in case GetAdaptersInfo() fails,
  to help in case of problems resulting from potential future API changes by
  Microsoft.

- Ensure SPS/RP Description/Code is never empty:
  Per DICOM standard, either SPS Description or Scheduled Protocol Code, as well
  as either Requested Procedure Description or Requested Protocol Code must be
  filled in (type 1C, with the condition that either one of both attributes in
  each of both cases must be supported). The old code permitted that if the
  respective sequence is filled in, the description may have an empty value.
  Now an empty value is forbidden for the descriptions and for the sequences
  in any case. One of both (for each case)  has to exist with a (non-empty)
  value.

- Socket handle now always passed as 64-bit on Win32:
  The network layer now always passes the socket handle as an unsigned 64-bit
  integer on Win32 platforms when using the multi-process code. The code
  that reads the socket handle from the pipe in the client process has been
  moved into a helper function named DUL_readSocketHandleAsForkedChild().

- Now setting LossyImageCompression when decompressing:
  All DCMTK-based image decompression codecs now insert the attribute
  LossyImageCompression with a value of 01 when decompressing an image
  encoded in a lossy transfer syntax. This makes sure that a warning
  about the reduced image quality remains in the dataset even if the
  encoder did not appropriately create it.

- Enhanced XSD definition of "UniqueIdentifier":
  Enhanced XML Schema (XSD) definition of the DICOM value representation
  "Unique Identifier" (UI), which was not as strict as possible. Actually,
  the first component of an OSI Object Identification (numeric form) always
  starts with "0", "1" or "2" but this is currently not checked in order to
  accept values that are sometimes used for testing purposes (e.g. "99.xxx").

**** Changes from 2017.04.13 (schlamelcher)

- Fixed and refactored running the unit tests via CTest:
  CTest will now always set the environment variable DCMDICTPATH appropriately
  such that the DICOM dictionaries from the source code folder will be used
  for running the tests. This prevents the test from failing caused by
  accidental use of a wrong dictionary or failing to load the dictionary.
  The test can now be executed via Wine and utilizing the Android emulator
  again, in both cases now also supporting to run the test in exhaustive mode
  (via make test-exhaustive etc.) and also correctly setting DCMDICTPATH.
  For both Android and Wine a CTestCustom.cmake file will be created to ensure:
  The Android emulator will be started, prepared and stopped as necessary, that
  is, the unit tests, required shared objects and now also the DICOM
  dictionaries will be copied to the device before running the tests.
  DCMDICTPATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH will be set accordingly on the device during
  test execution.
  The Wine variant of the CTestCustom.cmake will ensure that the 'wineserver'
  process is already running during test execution, preventing CTest from
  attaching itself to that process leading to unnecessary and annoying wait
  times before executing the next test.

- Warn if patient name may lead to broken dir name:
  The option --sort-on-patientname uses the patient name from received files
  in order to create a storage directory. The dir name is always in ASCII.
  storescp already defines a mapping from Latin-1 to ASCII. However, if
  a patient name uses a different character set, the latin-1 mapping is
  silently performed anyway.
  The new code does print a warning for cases where the patient name is not
  in ASCII or latin-1 denoting that the resulting directory name may be broken.
  Also, the current behaviour is documented.
  This fixes DCMTK Bug #557.

- Fixed and refactored cross compiling for Android:
  Removed previously introduced CMake function DCMTK_ATEXIT, since the utilized
  exploit seems to no longer work on newer versions of CMake. The Android
  emulator instance launched for performing the configuration tests will now
  only be shut down when/if CMake successfully finishes configuring the DCMTK
  build. This is hardly ideal, but there does not seem to be a proper solution
  with newer versions of CMake.
  Added a configuration test for detecting whether the implementation of 'lockf'
  that newer versions of Android provide can actually be used, i.e. whether it
  includes the definition of required macro constants.
  Fixed two breaking changes regarding the Android emulators command line
  arguments/handling.
  Modified accessing the emulator such that all commands will be executed with
  root access rights as a workaround for emulated devices of newer SDK versions
  not allowing access to /cache or executing applications on the sdcard.
  Removed outdated 'android.toolchain.cmake' that no longer works with newer SDK
  versions. Use the Android cross compiling support included in/provided by
  CMake version 3.7.2 and later instead!
  This commit will break running the unit tests on the Android emulator, which
  will be addressed by a follow-up refactoring of the unit test related CMake
  configuration.

- Refactored cross compiling support with MinGW/Wine:
  When cross compiling for Windows using MinGW/Wine, the configuration tests
  will now run in a specifically prepared wineprefix that is configured for
  linking the detected/configured MinGW runtime DLLs.
  The Wine instances will also be spawned as detached processes, with their
  IO streams redirected to temporary files. This works around a problem where
  CMake was waiting for the whole 'wineserver' process to shutdown instead of
  only the spawned application, before continuing the execution. The temporary
  files will be read and displayed etc. such that the user experience does not
  change significantly compared to before.
  This commit will break running the unit tests via Wine, which will be
  addressed by a follow-up refactoring of the unit test related CMake

- Check override keys in img2dcm library code:
  img2dcm silently ignored errors if override keys defined with the --key
  option (or by the library user) can neither be parsed to a valid tag nor
  tag dictionary name. Now the error is handled and returned to the user.
  Additionally, the related method now uses a unique pointer to ensure that
  all code paths are cleaning up memory in case of error.

**** Changes from 2017.04.11 (schlamelcher)

- Fixed a mistake in the code generating arith.h:
  The configuration test for inspecting the fundamental arithmetic types was
  written under the wrong assumption that std::isnormal tests for non-subnormal
  values. Instead isnormal returns true if the value is neither zero, subnormal
  NaN or infinity.
  The test now compares the given value with FLT_MIN resp. DBL_MIN instead,
  which should be more appropriate. Luckily, the results seem to be the same
  on the platforms we have tested so far.
  Affects: config/arith.cc

**** Changes from 2017.04.11 (onken)

- Fix backslash quoting for Windows --fork mode:
  Windows --fork mode in DCMTK sets quotes ("") around each command
  line argument before providing it to CreateProcess. If the last
  character in the argument is a backslash, it escaped the following
  appended quote so that the delimiter of that command line argument
  was missing.
  The fix checks whether the last character is a backslash, and if so,
  escapes it so the finalizing quote stays intact.

- Fixed CTest failing tests that did not compile:
  The previously introduced script based approach to run the unit tests for
  allowing additional parameters (e.g. -x) caused unit tests to fail if the
  respective test binary was unavailable instead of the correct and previous
  behavior to skip them.
  The respective binaries are now correctly marked as unit test dependency to
  restore the previous behavior.
  Affects: CMake/dcmtkMacros.cmake

- Added config tests for including libc.h and math.h:
  CMake now also determines whether <libc.h> and <math.h> may be included as
  extern "C" or must be included as C++ headers, instead of hardcoding the
  results that seem to have worked in the past but were never verified.
  Affects: CMake/GenerateDCMTKConfigure.cmake

- Modified CMake configuration regarding MinGW:
  CMake now uses the same path and environment separator etc. settings for MinGW
  as it does for other compilers that target native Windows (e.g. Visual
  Studio). The only remaining exception now is Cygwin, where the resulting
  executables are expected to be run in the Cygwin shell.

- Fixed issue reading XML template identification:
  Fixed issue when reading the template identification from XML input (e.g.
  using xml2dsr). Background: the internal value type "VT_includedTemplate"
  was mapped to the XML element name "template", which is also used for
  identifying the SR template in the XML document. Solution: use a different
  name for the mapping, i.e. something that never occurs in practice.

- Refactored low level network API usage:
  Created dcmnet header file dntypes.h defining platform independent socket
  file descriptor/handle data type etc.
  Added OFStandard::initializeNetwork() and OFStandard::shutdownNetwork().
  Employed above definitions to replace platform specific networking code
  everywhere except within oflog.

- DCMTK now uses SOCKET data type on Windows:
  While Posix systems use an int type to represent network sockets,
  Win32 uses a type named SOCKET, which is a 64-bit unsigned integer
  when compiling on x64. DCMTK now properly uses this type.

- dcmquant now by default generates OW LUT data:
  dcmquant now by default uses the OW value representation for the generated
  palette color LUT entries. Using US VR for these elements was retired with
  CP 143.

  This closes DCMTK bug #740.
  Affects: dcmsign/libsrc/sicertvf.cc

**** Changes from 2017.03.24 (schlamelcher)

- Fixed linking some dcmsr unit tests with MSVC:
  Fixed linking dcmsr_addItems and dcmsr_getItems when building shared libraries
  (DLLs) with Visual Studio. The tests had previously been disabled when
  building shared libraries since Visual Studio is unable to handle some of
  the symbols that are part of the DSRListOfItems template.
  This workaround employs a dummy class to create specific symbols for the tests
  only.
  Closes DCMTK bug #694.
  Affects: dcmsr/tests/tsrlist.cc

**** Changes from 2017.03.23 (onken)

- Added support for final text CP-1619:
  CP-1619 changed the attribute for the code segmentation algorithm from "Segment
  Surface Generation Algorithm Identification Sequence" to the new attribute
  "Segmentation Algorithm Identification Sequence". Class member and method names
  now reflect the new attribute.
  Existing implementations using those methods have to adapt their code.
  Segmentation objects that use the old sequence attribute will be read
  successfully, but the algorithm code data will be ignored, i.e. the new
  implementation does not evaluate the "Segment Surface Generation Algorithm
  Identification Sequence" any more. Since not many implementations of
  Segmentation objects can be found so far, only a few users are expected to be
  affected and those are warned since their existing code does not compile any
  more.
  Rationale from the CP:
  The Segmentation IOD currently only allows specification of algorithm
  parameters in the Segment Surface Generation Algorithm Identification Sequence.
  Create a new attribute that is not limited to "Surface Generation" and that may
  may be used for any segmentation algorithm.

- Suppressed an inappropriate Visual Studio warning.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcmatch.cc

- Refactored DSRListOfItems::EmptyItem:
  DSRListOfItems::EmptyItem is now no longer a static member variable but
  instead a global function template. While there was nothing wrong with the
  previous approach, the new one will hopefully have better compiler
  compatibility.
  Especially Visual Studio and some older versions of Clang have bugs that lead
  to problems with the previous approach when building shared objects (DLLs).

  In some cases specific Winsock functions are used, which only works when
  WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN is not defined while including <windows.h>. All these
  occurrences are now consistently marked with '#undef WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN' and
  an appropriate comment.

- Fixed problems regarding Windows include magic:
  Fixed problems caused by the previous commit that replaced OFauto_ptr with
  OFunique_ptr. The file 'ofmem.h' includes <windows.h> and defines
  WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN, which hides some Winsock functions required by dcmnet
  and dcmpstat.
  Explicitly included <windows.h> without defining WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN where
  needed as a workaround.
  Undefined the 'NEAR' macro from <windows.h> inside libcharls ('header.h'),
  as a workaround for libcharls using NEAR as variable name etc.

- Fixed incorrect usage of FindICU.cmake:
  FindICU.cmake is now used correctly be specifying which components are needed.
  This works with the FindICU.cmake we provide with the DCMTK and also the newer
  versions provided by CMake.
  Affects: CMake/3rdparty.cmake

- Modified config to prefer CMake's own FindXXX modules:
  Modified the CMake configuration to prefer the FindXXX modules provided by
  CMake (in ${CMAKE_ROOT}/Modules) instead of the ones we provide with DCMTK,
  since ours are only meant as a fallback for supporting older CMake versions.
  Affects: CMake/dcmtkPrepare.cmake

**** Changes from 2017.03.15 (eichelberg)

- JPEG/JPEG-LS padding now uses extended EOI marker:
  DCMTK now pads JPEG and JPEG-LS bitstreams that have odd length with an
  "extended" end of image (EOI) marker, writing ff/ff/d9 instead of adding
  a zero byte after the EOI marker, i.e. writing ff/d9/00. The old behaviour
  can be restored by defining the macro DISABLE_FF_JPEG_BITSTREAM_PADDING.
  This implements the following note from DICOM Part 5 Section A.4:
  "Any necessary padding may be added in the JPEG or JPEG-LS compressed data
  stream as per ISO 10918-1 and ISO 14495-1 such that the End of Image (EOI)
  marker ends on an even byte boundary, or may be appended after the EOI
  marker, depending on the implementation. ISO 10918-1 and ISO 14495-1 define
  the ability to add any number of padding bytes FFH before any marker (all
  of which also begin with FFH)."
  This closes DCMTK bug #658. Thanks to Mathieu Malaterre for the report.

- Fixed build date definition problem regarding Xcode:
  The compiler definition 'DCMTK_BUILD_DATE' is now differently escaped for
  Xcode. This affects building DCMTK snapshot packages that set DCMTK_BUILD_DATE
  to the day on which the snapshot was created. The previous escaping produced
  unparsable Xcode project files.
  Closes DCMTK bugs #497 and #651.

- Fixed inspecting fundamental arithmetic types:
  CMake will now re-run the inspection of fundamental arithmetic types
  (configuration test) if the test code ("arith.cc") is newer than the existing
  "arith.h".
  This fixes problems with incompatible "arith.h" files in re-used build
  directories if the configure test code was modified.

- Fixed installing manpages with CMake:
  CMake now installs manpages from the source code directory unless a newer
  version of a manpage exists in the build directory. This fixes installing
  manpages in out-of-source builds in case they are not explicitly generated
  via 'make man'.
  Inside source builds are not affected by this modification, since the manpage
  in the build and source directory are always identical in that case.
  Futhermore, CMake now omits unwanted directory index manpages generated by
  doxygen.
  Affects: doxygen/CMakeLists.txt

**** Changes from 2017.03.14 (eichelberg)

- Parser can now be stopped before a certain tag:
  Added methods to the dcmdata parser that allow the read process
  to be stopped before a certain tag is fully processed. This also
  works if the given tag (which must be on the main dataset level)
  is not present in file, i.e. no higher tag is parsed/processed.
  Added --stop-before-elem command line option to dcmdump to
  enable use of these new methods.
  This closes DCMTK patch #347. Thanks to Jeroen Eggermont for
  the suggestion and the (partial) patch.

- OFMutex on Win32 now based on cricital sections:
  The Win32 version of the OFMutex class now internally uyses critical
  sections instead of Win32 mutexes, because critical sections are much
  faster. The macro USE_WIN32_CREATE_MUTEX can be defined to revert to
  the old implementation.

- Updated data dictionary for DICOM 2017a:
  Updated data dictionary for the latest edition of the DICOM standard, which
  has been released today. Since DCMTK's data dictionary was already up-to-date
  regarding the recently approved Supplements and CPs, there are no changes
  apart from the "Version" column.

- Added support for writing GE private transfer syntax:
  dcmconv can now convert image files to the historical private GE
  implicit VR little endian with big endian pixel data transfer syntax,
  mostly for testing purposes.
  Affects: dcmdata/apps/dcmconv.cc
           dcmdata/docs/dcmconv.man

**** Changes from 2017.03.08 (onken)

- Fixed wrong buffer size for sprintf:
  Fixed wrong buffer size allocated for sprintf operation. The old code does not
  take into account that sprintf needs one extra byte for the \0 byte it
  automatically appends.
  Affects: dcmqrdb/libsrc/dcmqrdbi.cc

**** Changes from 2017.03.08 (riesmeier)

- Updated the code meaning of a "UCUM" code:
  Updated the code meaning of the UCUM code "{counts}/s" in order to be
  consistent with the latest version of the DICOM standard.
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/codes/ucum.h

- Updated code definitions for "SRT":
  Manually updated code definitions for the coding scheme "SRT": added code
  for "Imaging Procedure" and removed retired code for "Liver".

**** Changes from 2017.03.03 (riesmeier)

- Fixed wrong comment on private GE transfer syntax:
  Fixed wrong comment on recently introduced private GE transfer syntax.
  It is almost identical to "Implicit VR Little Endian" and not to
  "Explicit VR Little Endian" (with the exception of the pixel data).
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dcuid.h

- Removed redundant "TransferSyntax" suffix:
  Removed redundant "TransferSyntax" suffix from recently introduced "EXS_..."
  enum definition. This has already been done for all other definitions back
  in 2011 (see commit 51535a1).
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dcxfer.h

**** Changes from 2017.03.03 (eichelberg)

- Added partial support for GE private transfer syntax:
  Added partial support for the historical GE implicit VR little endian
  transfer syntax with big endian pixel data. The transfer syntax
  UID is now recognized, but correct byte order swapping of pixel data
  not yet implemented.

  from an underlying character encoding library (same as for other tools).
  Affects: dcmqrdb/docs/dcmqrscp.man

- Manual fixes to data dictionary (DICOM 2017a):
  Manual fixes to data dictionary according to the draft release of DICOM
  2017a. Two attributes were wrong in Supplement 131: (0068,62F0) and
  (0076,0034).

**** Changes from 2017.03.02 (riesmeier)

- Fixed output of network debug information:
  Fixed output of very low-level debug information in the network routines,
  e.g. added missing newlines, fixed indentation, added missing typecast.
  Since this output is usually disabled (for good reasons), a typical toolkit
  user will not see any difference. Anyway, it might be useful for very deep
  debugging sessions.

**** Changes from 2017.03.02 (eichelberg)

- Fixed responding aetitle in ASC_dumpParameters():
  ASC_dumpParameters() will now always show the responding aetitle
  to be  identical to the called aetitle. This DICOM rule is enforced
  in the DUL network layer, but the output of this function showed a
  different value.
  This fixes bug #375.
  Affects: dcmnet/libsrc/assoc.cc

**** Changes from 2017.03.01 (eichelberg)

- Length check for DICOM implementation version name:

- Fixed previous commit:
  The previous commit would have broken the else case.
  Affects: dcmqrdb/libsrc/dcmqrdbi.cc

- Fixed dcmqrdb falsely retrying response conversion:
  The dcmqrdb library does no longer retry response conversion if the fall-back
  character set and the originally requested one are the same. This is more
  efficient and prevents duplicated warning output.
  Affects: dcmqrdb/libsrc/dcmqrdbi.cc

  The "key matching type", specifying which type of matching should be
  performed, has been removed from DB_FindAttr - so should the comment.
  Affects: dcmqrdb/libsrc/dcmqrdbi.cc

- Added "Issuer of Patient ID" to documentation:
  Added Issuer of Patient ID (0010,0021) to the documentation since it was
  added only recently as a supported Query Key to the implementation (see
  commit b1f5c6c).

  Affects: config/docs/macros.txt

**** Changes from 2017.02.28 (schlamelcher)

- Fixed wrong value range check in extractDigits():
  OFStandard::extractDigits() used the wrong member of OFnumeric_limits to check
  whether the given type could hold the requested number of digits (base two
  digits instead of base 10).
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/ofstd.h

  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/ofstd.h

**** Changes from 2017.02.27 (schlamelcher)

- Fixed Q/R matching on failed character set conversion:
  Added error handling for the on the fly character set conversion during
  attribute matching in dcmqrdb. The dcmqrdb library will now use the original
  value if character set conversion fails, instead of the empty value that
  caused Universal Matching behavior inappropriately.

  parsing time zone information from date time values that did not contain a
  time value (e.g. 2017+0100).
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcvrdt.cc

- Added character set conversion support to dcmqrdb:
  The dcmqrdb library now supports on the fly character set conversion for
  attribute matching and converting the find response to the requested character
  set.
  The matching has been refactored to use DcmAttributeMatching internally.
  Increased the size of attributes that are affected by Specific Character Set
  in the index file so that values using multi byte encodings may still fit.

**** Changes from 2017.02.24 (schlamelcher)

- Introduced DcmAttributeMatching:
  DcmAttributeMatching implements the different attribute matching functions
  defined in the DICOM standard for Query/Retrieve and Worklist queries.
  DcmAttributeMatching may either be used by explicitly calling one of its
  static member matching functions or by creating an DcmAttributeMatching
  object for a specific VR.

**** Changes from 2017.02.24 (schlamelcher)

- Refactored string to date and time conversion:
  Refactored DcmDate, DcmTime and DcmDateTime string parser functions to work
  on character string + size input in addition to the existing functions that
  work on OFStrings. The new functions do not require the strings to be zero
  terminated and are therefore composable.
  DcmDateTime::getOFDateTimeFromString is now implemented based on
  DcmTime::getOFTimeFromString, which is now possible since the functions
  can now be used on substrings without unnecessary copies.
  Default parameters have been replaced by respective overloads to provide
  a consistent API in all three classes (all now have a function that takes
  no additional parameters to the string and the result).

- Added string to number helper functions:
  Added helper functions for extracting fixed length unsigned integer numbers
  from character strings that do not require the strings to be zero terminated.
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/ofstd.h

- Added comparison operators for OFDateTime:
  Added less, greater, less or equal and greater or equal comparison operators
  to OFDateTime.

**** Changes from 2017.02.15 (riesmeier)

- Enhanced logging in case of error:
  Enhanced output to the logger in case of fatal errors, e.g. if the DICOMDIR
  file to be updated is invalid/corrupted.
  Affects: dcmdata/apps/dcmgpdir.cc

- Fixed crash while processing an invalid DICOMDIR:
  Fixed a crash that could occur while processing an invalid DICOMDIR file,
  e.g. when a single Directory Record was referenced more than once and,
  therefore, deleted more than once (from the DcmDicomDir destructor). Now,
  an error is both reported to the logger and returned to the caller.
  The main changes were done to DcmDicomDir::moveRecordToTree(). Additionally,
  slightly enhanced comments on other functions and improved the logger output.
  Thanks to forum user "psih128" for the report and for the sample file.
  Closes DCMTK Bug #388.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcdicdir.cc

**** Changes from 2017.02.14 (grallert)

**** Changes from 2017.02.10 (onken)

- Fixed missing assignment from last commit:
  Enhanced intendation.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcitem.cc

- Hide public element constructors setting length:
  DCMTK's VR classes allowed to construct new DICOM elements by tag and a
  given length value. Internally the length is set, however, no related memory
  is allocated. This is the desired behaviour when reading new DICOM datasets
  since after creation of the element with a specific length after reading tag
  and length from the stream, the value is read and set on the element right
  afterwards.
  However, if such an element is created manually by a user who tries afterwards
  to access (read or write) a value to that element, a crash can occur since
  the element itself expects to have memory allocated up to the given length.
  In order to fix this, the related VR classes' constructors have been removed
  from the public interface and have been made protected. So far, only DcmItem
  and partly DcmDirectoryRecord (as "parsing" classes constructing elements in
  the valid way described above) need direct access to those constructors and
  thus have been amended by related friend declarations.
  The global functions newDicomElement(...) that use those constructors directly
  or indirectly have been moved into DcmItem as static methods. The ones that
  can be used publicly (those only taking tag and not length), are made public
  while the only one taking length (and other parsing parameters) is protected
  and is only used by DcmItem or safely from within other public methods.
  An alternative approach would have been to change the parsing behaviour
  that constructs element with explicit length first, in order to fill them
  with a value in the second step. Instead, onld could construct with 0
  length and only set the length when actually setting the value. This
  would make the explicit length constructors superfluous.
  However, since the parser's internals are quite complicated regarding
  length handling, it was not touched for now. However, the work done may make
  it easier to change the parser accordingly later.
  Another approach would be to always allocate memory in the constructors.
  However this will lead often to double initializations since most methods
  that set a value in a subsequent call will delete that memory to allocate
  the value newly a second time. Also, the possibility to create elements with
  an explicit empty value of a specific length is of limited use: For number-
  based VRs this can easily be imitated by calling the related set() method
  afterwards, while for strings it is not even clear what an empty value
  of a specifc length might be.

**** Changes from 2017.02.08 (riesmeier)

- Added two missing SOP Classes to modality table:
  Added two missing non-patient Storage SOP Classes to the modality table,
  which e.g. maps a known UID to a short character code ("modality") that
  can be used to generate a meaningful filename prefix. That way, a storage
  receiver of a Color Palette Storage object will generate a filename
  starting with "CP." instead of "UNKNOWN." (which is the default in case
  of an unknown UID).
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcuid.cc

- Fixed name numberOfAllDcmStorageSOPClassUIDs:
  Fixed inconsistent name numberOfAllDcmStorageSOPClassUIDs by renaming
  it to numberOfDcmAllStorageSOPClassUIDs since the related global array
  is called dcmAllStorageSOPClassUIDs and not allDcmStorageSOPClassUIDs.

           dcmqrdb/libsrc/dcmqrsrv.cc

- Allow for sending non-patient DICOM objects:
  The storescu and dcmsend tool (based on the class DcmStorageSCU) are now
  able to send non-patient DICOM objects. The latter was already able to do
  so but reported a warning to the DEBUG logger that an "unknown storage SOP
  class (with standard UID prefix)" is to be transferred. This warning has
  now disappeared.
  This partly closes DCMTK Conformance #695.
  Affects: dcmnet/apps/storescu.cc
           dcmnet/libsrc/dstorscu.cc

- Further enhanced support for non-patient objects:
  Added optional parameter to dcmIsaStorageSOPClassUID() that allows for
  checking a given SOP Class UID for being a known Storage SOP Class UID
  of a non-patient DICOM object. Also added support to check for image
  objects only. The default behavior of this function has not changed,
  i.e. only those Storage SOP Classes are covered that fit into into the
  conventional PATIENT-STUDY-SERIES-INSTANCE information model.
  The function dcmIsImageStorageSOPClassUID() is now only a shortcut for
  calling dcmIsaStorageSOPClassUID() with the new type parameter being
  ESSC_Image. This is useful in order to be backward compatible.

- Cleanup of comments (retired DICOM SOP Classes).
  Affects: dcmnet/etc/storescp.cfg

- Further fixes regarding non-patient objects:
  Replaced some non-patient DICOM objects in dcmLongSCUStorageSOPClassUIDs by
  the three Legacy Converted Enhanced Image objects. This is another step
  towards a clearer distinction between patient and non-patient objects.
  Also see DCMTK Conformance #695.

- Fixes for non-patient DICOM Storage Objects:
  Various fixes for non-patient DICOM Storage Objects such as Color Palette
  or Generic Implant Template Storage. The array dcmAllStorageSOPClassUIDs
  only contains the UIDs of those Storage SOP Classes that fit into the
  conventional PATIENT-STUDY-SERIES-INSTANCE information model. Of course,
  all other DICOM objects for which the Storage Service is defined should
  also be transferred using a C-STORE message.

- Added new sample association negotiation profile:
  Added new sample association negotiation profile "AllDICOM" for SCPs, e.g.
  for storescp or dcmrecv. This new profile allows for accepting all 126
  Storage SOP Classes that are currently defined in the DICOM standard (i.e.
  without retired, draft, DICOS and DICONDE Storage SOP Classes).
  Affects: dcmnet/etc/storescp.cfg

- Moved latest post-read checks to DcmDataset:
  Moved the recently introduced post-read checks into DcmDataset since they only
  apply to datasets and not general purpose items. This eliminates the need of
  explicitly checking in the code whether it is working on top level or not.

**** Changes from 2017.02.03 (onken)

- Report error in case of wrong Pixel Data encoding:
  It has been reported that some DICOM datasets do write encapsulated pixel data
  without following the related rules, i.e. to use undefined length for the Pixel
  Data element and to use Pixel Sequence and Pixel Items inside.
  So far such files (using defined length on encapsulated Pixel Data) have been
  read without any warnings or errors giving the impression that the data is
  valid.
  Now, DCMTK will per default report an error if reading such files. There is a
  global switch which permits to enforce the old behaviour, i.e. to read such
  files as if the encoding would be correct. However, in that case a warning
  is printed.
  Options demonstrating the flag have been added to dcmdump and dcmconv.
  The new functionality is aware of the fact that Pixel Data not being part of
  the top level dataset, i.e. nested within sequences, must not use the
  encapsulated format but remain uncompressed (as for icon images).
  The validity of internal structures of the Pixel Data element (Pixel Sequence
  and Items) is not checked by this new compatibility flag.
  This closes DCMTK Bug #427.

  Affects: dcmdata/apps/dcmconv.cc

**** Changes from 2017.02.01 (riesmeier)

- Added further support for Supplement 195 (HEVC):

- Fixed bug introduced with last commit (crash):
  Fixed a severe bug introduced with the last commit that caused the tool to
  crash if option --accept-all (+xa) was used. The reason was that the size
  of the array "transferSyntaxes" was not increased even though new entries
  were added to it (namely, three new MPEG4 transfer syntaxes).

- Updated credits with regard to the Debian package.
  Affects: CREDITS

- Removed useless "option block" for single option.

- Use DCM_MaxReadLength as the default value:
  Use DCM_MaxReadLength as the default value for the "maxReadLength" parameter
  and not "4096", i.e. a numerical value. Also fixed source code formatting.
  Affects: dcmdata/apps/dcm2json.cc

- Made sure that a value is loaded before modified:
  Made sure that an element value is actually loaded before it is modified
  with DcmElement::changeValue(). This fixes a possible crash (segmentation
  fault) in case the "maxReadLength" parameter of the various loadFile/read
  methods was set to a very low value (i.e., less than 4).
  Thanks to Michael Schinner <Michael.Schinner@ith-icoserve.com> for the bug
  report and for the test program that demonstrates this crash.

**** Changes from 2017.01.31 (grallert)

- Removed unused command line parameters from dcm2json:

  meaning for dcm2json (all elements will be read as needed for the JSON output
  anyway).
  Affects: dcmdata/apps/dcm2json.cc

- Refactored dcmqrdb element list to use new/delete:
  Dcmqrdb's list implementation is now created and destroyed using new/delete
  instead of malloc/free. This ensures all list element members are correctly
  initialized via the constructor and enables the use of non-POD types inside
  the list.

- Added DcmSpecificCharacterSet state checking methods:
  The initialization state (i.e. whether selectCharacterSet was called before)
  of an DcmSpecificCharacterSet object can now be queried via the corresponding
  operator OFBool and operator! methods. This eases using a persistent object
  for multiple character set conversions.

**** Changes from 2017.01.27 (riesmeier)

- Removed gethostbyname from compatibility header:
  Removed gethostbyname() function from dcmnet's old compatibility header file
  since this function has been wrapped and moved to ofstd with commit a144346.
  Affects: dcmnet/include/dcmtk/dcmnet/dcompat.h

- Removed obsolete macro (Windows 95 workaround):
  Removed the obsolete macro NO_WINDOWS95_ADDRESS_TRANSLATION_WORKAROUND,
  which probably nobody every used. Since the gethostbyname() function,
  at least officially, does not accept an IP address on many operating
  systems, the "workaround" is now the only way of doing it. And, since
  it was already the default behavior for almost 20 years now, nothing
  changes at all.

- Added explicit typecast to function parameter:
  Added explicit typecast to "int" parameter of Windows function
  WideCharToMultiByte() in order to avoid a compiler warning.
  Affects: ofstd/libsrc/ofstd.cc

- Changed type for index/number of sequence items:
  Changed data type used for the index and number of sequence items. The type
  "size_t" seems to be more appropriate than "unsigned long" since internally
  an OFList (subset of std:list) instance is used for the data management.
  As a consequence, VisualStudio and other compilers will not warn anymore on
  a "possible loss of data" (warning C4267).

- Pass value of correct type to "size" parameter:
  Pass value of correct type to "size" parameter of the getOutputData()
  method of class DicomImage, i.e. "unsigned long" instead of "size_t".
  This avoids a warning message being reported by certain compilers, e.g.
  VisualStudio 2015 (x64).
  Affects: dcmrt/libsrc/drmimage.cc

- Added missing brackets to "if( || )" statement.
  Affects: ofstd/tests/toffile.cc

- Minor cleanup in dump output of TLS connections:
  Fixed indentation and newlines in dump output of TLS connections.
  Affects: dcmtls/libsrc/tlslayer.cc

- Disable exception throwing in destructor:
  Don't throw an exception from the destructor in order to avoid that the
  application terminates abruptly. The original code line comes from the
  underlying Log4cplus library.
  Affects: oflog/libsrc/hierlock.cc

**** Changes from 2017.01.20 (onken)

- Added hints that memory has to be freed by caller:
  Added hints that Segmentation and Tractography Results objects that are created
  by the existing static methods have to be freed by the caller.

**** Changes from 2017.01.20 (riesmeier)

- Enhanced comments on charset to library mapping:
  Enhanced comments on the mapping between DICOM character sets and the
  underlying conversion libraries. Also fixed various vaguenesses.
  Bottom line is: only the GNU libiconv (as of version 1.14) supports ALL
  character sets that are currently defined in the DICOM standard. Both ICU
  and the stdlibc iconv() function lack support of some Japanese character
  sets, e.g. "ISO-IR-87" (JIS X 0201) and "ISO-IR-159" (JIS X 0212).
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcspchrs.cc

- Included missing standard header "assert":
  Added missing standard header "assert.h" or "cassert" in order to compile
  when HAVE_STL and HAVE_STD_STRING are defined. This header file is needed
  for Linux systems with gcc (and probably others).
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcjson.cc

- Removed unused variable from writeJsonOpener().
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcelem.cc

- Added missing header include (without OpenSSL):
  When compiled without OpenSSL support, the header file "dcmtrans.h" also
  needs to be included for the new settings dcmSocketSend/ReceiveTimeout.
  Affects: dcmnet/apps/storescp.cc
           dcmnet/apps/storescu.cc

- Fixed typos in API documentation.
  Affects: dcmnet/include/dcmtk/dcmnet/dcmtrans.h

**** Changes from 2017.01.19 (riesmeier)

- Added new option --socket-timeout to storescu/scp:
  Added new option --socket-timeout, which allows for specifying the timeout
  for sending and receiving data on a network socket. A default of 60 seconds
  is useful in cases where the sender (e.g. storescu) looses the connection
  to the receiver (e.g. storescp) because the network cable is pulled or the
  like. A value 0 means that the send() or recv() function never timeouts.
  Affects: dcmnet/apps/storescp.cc

           dcmnet/docs/storescp.man

- Made send() and recv() timeout configurable:
  Made the timeout for the send() and recv() function configurable, i.e. the
  default value of 60 seconds can now be changed at runtime. The previously
  used macros DISABLE_RECV_TIMEOUT and DISABLE_SEND_TIMEOUT have, therefore,
  become obsolete.
  This partly closes DCMTK Bug #618.
  Affects: config/docs/macros.txt
           dcmnet/include/dcmtk/dcmnet/dcmtrans.h
           dcmnet/libsrc/dcmtrans.cc

- Added #warning on DONT_DISABLE_NAGLE_ALGORITHM:
  Added warning during compilation if outdated DONT_DISABLE_NAGLE_ALGORITHM
  is still used. Also readded this previously supported macro to the main
  documentation file with a hint on the new behavior.
  Affects: config/docs/macros.txt
           dcmnet/libsrc/dul.cc

- Minor corrections to documentation/comments.
  Affects: dcmnet/include/dcmtk/dcmnet/dul.h

- Simplified output of default option values:
  Simplified output of default option values and also of the range of valid
  values. This approach is now consistent with other tools like "storescu".
  Affects: dcmnet/apps/storescp.cc

**** Changes from 2017.01.19 (onken)

- Fixed potential NULL pointer and implicit casts:
  Two potential NULL pointer derefences have been fixed as well as various
  implicit casts that could lead to data loss. Guards have been added where
  necessary and remaining (safe) casts have been made explicit.

- Do not pass simple const parameters by reference.
  Affects: dcmnet/include/dcmtk/dcmnet/assoc.h
           dcmnet/libsrc/assoc.cc

- Do not disable Nagle algorithm by default:
  Beginning with DCMTK 3.4.1, the so-called Nagle algorithm was disabled by
  default for each DICOM transport connection in order to increase the network
  performance, especially on Windows systems. However, on most modern operating
  systems this default does not seem to be appropriate anymore. Therefore, the
  default has been changed and the compiler macro DONT_DISABLE_NAGLE_ALGORITHM
  has been replaced by DISABLE_NAGLE_ALGORITHM, so at compilation time the Nagle
  algorithm can still be disabled (if needed). In addition, the environment
  variable NO_TCPDELAY allows for changing this default at runtime.
  See "config/docs/macros.txt" and "config/docs/envvars.txt" for details.

- Fixed maximum number of bytes to read from stdin:
  Limit maximum number of bytes to read from stdin in order to avoid a
  possible buffer overflow. This issue has been reported by the static
  code analysis tool of VisualStudio 2015.
  Also fixed various typos in comments.
  Affects: dcmnet/apps/storescp.cc

**** Changes from 2017.01.17 (onken)

- Avoid another variable shadow warning.
  Affects: dcmpmap/libsrc/dpmparametricmapiod.cc

- Print conn. timeout to TRACE instead DEBUG level:
  If select() runs into a timeout when listening for TCP connections, a message
  was printed to the DEBUG log level. Since this can occur quite often (depending
  on the timeout), the message has been moved to the TRACE logger instead.
  Affects: dcmnet/libsrc/diutil.cc

**** Changes from 2017.01.16 (riesmeier)

- Do not set TCP send and receive buffer length:
  By default, don't set the TCP send and receive buffer length anymore since
  modern operating systems know much better what appropriate values are. If
  the user wants, he can still specify a certain buffer length by using the
  environment variable TCP_BUFFER_LENGTH (which was already supported by
  previous versions of the DCMTK).

  patch and forum user "tpalagyi" (and others) for the original report.

- Added another character set test (for ISO-IR 149):
  Added another character set conversion test that checks for the automatic
  detection of 8- vs. 16-bit characters when using "ISO 2022 IR 149".
  Affects: dcmdata/tests/tspchrs.cc

**** Changes from 2017.01.13 (riesmeier)

- Fixed issue with wrong detection of delimiters:
  Fixed issue with wrong detection of delimiters (such as a backslash) when
  converting a character string with multi-byte character set and code
  extensions. Also enhanced support for character sets that use one or two
  bytes per character such as "ISO 2022 IR 149".
  Thanks to Bhuvan Bose <bhuvanbose86@gmail.com> for the original report and
  for the sample DICOM object (using "\ISO 2022 IR 87" character set).
  Closes DCMTK Bug #684.

**** Changes from 2017.01.06 (onken)

- Better SCP timeouts, test, cleanups and more docs:
  A new possibility was added to return from DcmSCP's listen() loop in
  non-blocking mode. A dedicated return code has been added, as well as
  for the existing "stop after current association" feature. A test was added
  to ensure DcmSCP works as expected.
  Some methods have been cleaned up, especially calls for freeing association
  structures have been concentrated into a single call.
  Some further documentation was added, including possible return codes of
  some important methods.

**** Changes from 2017.01.02 (onken)

- Fixed installation of DCMTKConfigVersion.cmake:
  DCMTKConfigVersion.cmake has not been installed, thus leading to an error
  when importing DCMTK through find_package() with a specified version from
  other CMake-based projects.
  Thanks to Waldir Pimenta<waldir.pimenta@gmail.com> for the report and
  suggested patch.
  Closes DCMTK Bug #708.

  clang with -fsanitize=integer.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcstack.cc

**** Changes from 2016.12.14 (schlamelcher)

- Added magic word and version checks to dcmqrdb:
  All dcmqrdb applications will now prefix the index file with the magic word
  'QRDB' followed by two hexadecimal version digits. Both will be verified
  whenever an existing index file is opened for reading/modification.
  Please note that index files with the same magic word and version might still
  be binary incompatible with each other if they originate from different
  platforms (e.g. with different endianness or alignment). This mechanism is
  meant to catch cases where the index must be re-created due to dcmtk updates.
  Don't forget to re-create your database indices using dcmqridx.

**** Changes from 2016.12.09 (riesmeier)

- Avoid compiler warning on unused parameter:
  Avoid compiler warning on unused parameter, e.g. when compiling with gcc
  -Wextra. Also the read and write item methods return EC_NotYetImplemented
  instead of EC_Normal since no real content is ever read or written.
  Closes DCMTK Bug #705.
  Affects: dcmrt/libsrc/drtmas.cc

**** Changes from 2016.12.08 (riesmeier)

- Added comments on ICU conversions flags:
  Added comments that ICU also supports other "conversions flags" and that
  the (currently, very basic) implementation might be enhanced in the future.
  Affects: ofstd/libsrc/ofchrenc.cc

- Fixed wrong check on GLIBC macro:
  Instead of "__GLIBC__" the macro "__GLIBC_" was checked, i.e. one trailing
  underscore character was missing.
  Affects: ofstd/libsrc/ofchrenc.cc

**** Changes from 2016.12.07 (riesmeier)

- Renamed isAvailable() and getVersionString():
  Renamed the methods isAvailable() and getVersionString() back to their
  original names, i.e. as they have been before the "refactoring". Now,
  it is more consistent with other "libraries" used (e.g. "IJG" for JPEG)
  and also easier to understand for a user of the API.

**** Changes from 2016.12.07 (schlamelcher)

- Several fixes regarding character set conversion:
  Fixed building with enabled C++11 support.
  Fixed the code to suppress unnecessary warnings about TheImplementation being
  in the wrong #if - #else - #endif segment.
  Fixed building with iconv from another C standard library than the GNU one.
  Renamed some macros/settings to reflect above changes (gnuc -> stdlibc etc.).

  compatibility only and has no effect for Clang.
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/diag/overflow.def

**** Changes from 2016.12.06 (schlamelcher)

- Refactored character set conversion classes:
  Refactored character set conversion to support additional implementations,
  currently also the International Components for Unicode (ICU) and the ICONV
  implementation builtin the GNU C library are also supported, in addition to
  the already supported external ICONV library.

**** Changes from 2016.11.30 (riesmeier)

- Limit number of entries in optimization LUT:
  Made sure that the number of look-up table entries used internally for
  the optimized pixel data processing does not exceed a certain limit.
  Especially, made sure that there is no numeric oveflow, which resulted
  in a segmentation fault on 32-bit systems when processing DICOM images
  with high bit depth (e.g. Bits Allocated / Stored = 32).
  Thanks to John Stark <jstark@therapixel.com> for the original report.

**** Changes from 2016.11.28 (riesmeier)

- Added "Simplified Adult Echo SR" to ReportType.
  Affects: dcmsr/data/dsr2xml.xsd

- Added missing character sets to XML Schema:
  Added various Asian character sets to the XML Schema. Support for these
  character sets was added to the C++ implementation some time ago but the
  XML Schema was - apparently - not updated.
  Affects: dcmsr/data/dsr2xml.xsd

- Added tests for "new" Chinese characters sets:
  Added tests for Chinese character sets that were introduced with CP-1234:
  GB 2312 (also known as ISO-2022-CN) and GBK (a subset of GB 18030).
  Currently, it is only checked whether the associated Defined Terms for
  the Specific Character Set attribute are really supported.
  Affects: dcmdata/tests/tspchrs.cc

- Replaced boolean modes in convertCharacterSet():
  Replaced boolean parameters "transliterate" and "discardIllegal" of the
  convertCharacterSet() methods by a single "flags" parameter (as it is
  used for other similar methods in the various "dcmdata" classes). This
  allows for adding further "modes" in the future without changing the
  signature of the character set conversion methods.

  message reported by gcc (on some systems with certain flags, e.g. Ubuntu).
  This finally closes DCMTK Bug #379.
  Affects: dcmqrdb/libsrc/dcmqrdbi.cc

- Check return value of fgets() to avoid warnings:

  Affects: dcmqrdb/libsrc/dcmqrcnf.cc

**** Changes from 2016.11.25 (eichelberg)

- Use fseek() instead of rewind() on Win32/Cygwin:
  On Win32 and Cygwin systems, rewind() fails if the file is read-only
  and was read to EOF before the call to rewind(). Now using fseek()
  instead in OFFile::rewind().
  This fixes bug #378.
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/offile.h

- Increased buffer sizes to avoid buffer overflows:
  Increased buffer sizes to size of input string avoid possible buffer
  overflows caused by calls to sscanf with %s parameter.

  Affects: dcmnet/docs/movescu.man

- movescu now returns non-zero if c-move was unsuccessful:
  The movescu command line application now returns non-zero if the
  status of one or more c-move responses is warning or error and also
  prints a warning message to the logger. This simplifies the use of the
  tool in shell scripts, which can check for the return code.
  This closes feature request #652.
  Affects: dcmnet/apps/movescu.cc

**** Changes from 2016.11.23 (schlamelcher)

- Fixed an OFnumeric_limits problem regarding C++11:
  The previous fix for OFnumeric_limits did not consider the availability of
  C++11's std::numeric_limits, leading to name clashes if C++11 support was
  enabled.
  Affects: ofstd/libsrc/oflimits.cc

**** Changes from 2016.11.23 (riesmeier)

- Added comments on transfer syntax name changes:
  With DICOM 2016e, the official names of the MPEG2 transfer syntaxes changed.
  Added a comment to both the corresponding UID and "Xfer names" definitions.
  However, the constants and defines have not been changed because of backward
  compatibility.
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dcuid.h
           dcmdata/libsrc/dcxfer.cc

- Now use code constant CODE_DCM_PulseSequenceName.
  Affects: dcmsr/libcmr/tid1600.cc

- Updated code definitions for DICOM 2016e:
  Updated automatically generated code definitions for coding scheme "DCM",
  "NCIt" and "UMLS" for the 2016e edition of the DICOM standard. For the
  two latter ones, there were no changes.

- Updated data dictionary for DICOM 2016e:
  Updated data dictionary for the latest edition of the DICOM standard, which
  has been released on 2016-11-21. Since DCMTK's data dictionary was already
  up-to-date regarding the recently approved Supplements and CPs, there are no
  changes apart from the "Version" column.

- Removed additional library dependencies:
  Removed additional library dependencies from "libsrc/CMakeLists.txt" files
  that are not needed since these dependencies are already specified by other
  linked libraries (using the CMake macro "DCMTK_TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES").

**** Changes from 2016.11.23 (eichelberg)

- Added legal remark concerning HP's JPEG-LS patents:
  Added legal remark to dcmjpls documentation concerning HP's JPEG-LS
  patents and the possibility to receive a free license from HP.
  This closes #377.
  Affects: dcmjpls/docs/License.txt
           dcmjpls/docs/dcmjpls.dox

- Improved 8/12/16 bit JPEG code consistency:
  Minor edits to keep data structures and variable names in the 8, 12
  and 16 bit versions of the JPEG codec more consistent.
  This closes bug #654.
  Affects: dcmjpeg/libijg12/jdmarker.c
           dcmjpeg/libijg12/jpeglib12.h
           dcmjpeg/libijg16/jpeglib16.h
           dcmjpeg/libijg8/jpeglib8.h

- JPEG decoder now decompresses incomplete bitstreams:
  Added codec flag and command line option in dcmdjpeg to permit
  decompression of faulty images with incomplete JPEG bitstreams.
  Instead of trying to read more JPEG data from the next fragment,
  the decoder simply skips to the next frame when activated.
  This closes bug #571.

**** Changes from 2016.11.22 (riesmeier)

- Fixed issue with option "--display-overlay 0":
  Using option "--display-overlay 0" (or "+O 0") did not work because of a
  too strict range check. This issue was apparently not found in the past
  since this option is actually the default (i.e. show all overlay planes).
  Affects: dcmimage/apps/dcm2pnm.cc

- Rebuilt Makefile dependencies.
  Affects: ofstd/libsrc/Makefile.dep
           ofstd/tests/Makefile.dep

- Re-added tab characters removed by last commit.
  Affects: ofstd/libsrc/Makefile.in

**** Changes from 2016.11.21 (hasenpusch)

- Fixed OFSemaphore for macOS:
  The OFSemaphore class on macOS now uses Apple's dispatch framework as it
  contains the only functional unnamed semaphore implementation.
  The OFThread tests now all succeed.
  This fixes DCMTK bug #382.
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/ofthread.h
           ofstd/libsrc/ofthread.cc
           ofstd/tests/tthread.cc

**** Changes from 2016.11.21 (schlamelcher)

- Suppressed warnings in OFThread's unit test:
  Suppressed inappropriate warnings about parameter name shadowing, see docu-
  mentation of the employed macro.
  Affects: ofstd/tests/tthread.cc

- Suppressed silly Visual Studio warnings in OFvariant.
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/variadic/variant.h

- Several fixes for OFnumeric_limits:
  Fixed building with GCC using '-pedantic' by moving some definitions from the
  header to the new source file oflimits.cc.
  Suppressed type conversion warnings in the unit test that are also unneces-
  sary, since they are about what is being tested there.
  Added:   ofstd/libsrc/oflimits.cc
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/oflimits.h
           ofstd/libsrc/CMakeLists.txt
           ofstd/libsrc/Makefile.in
           ofstd/tests/tlimits.cc

- Added support for additional compiler diagnostics:
  Introduced three new macros to ofdiag.h and added related definition files.
  Enhanced documentation of ofdiag.h regarding supported compilers.
  Added:   ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/diag/cnvrsn.def

  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/ofdiag.h

**** Changes from 2016.11.18 (eichelberg)

- Fixed empty pixel data bug in DcmPixelData::write():
  Fixed bug in DcmPixelData::write() that caused an empty Pixel Data
  element to be written when the caller tried to write a compressed
  image in uncompressed transfer syntax without a prior call to
  chooseRepresentation() or canWriteXfer(). Now an error is returned.
  This closes bug #701.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcpixel.cc

**** Changes from 2016.11.18 (schlamelcher)

- Suppressed an inappropriate Visual Studio warning:
  Suppressed an inappropriate Visual Studio warning about template specializa-
  tion in dcmsr. The affected code is not about template specialization but in-
  stead about static member initialization, the warning can therefore safely
  be ignored.
  Added:   ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/diag/nsdfti.def

**** Changes from 2016.11.18 (eichelberg)

- JPEG encoder now writes SOF1 marker in 8-bit ext sequential TS:
  The JPEG encoder now always writes a SOF1 marker when encoding pixel data
  in the extended sequential transfer syntax with 8 bit/sample.
  This implements support for DICOM CP 1447 and closes bug #620 and #663.
  Affects: dcmjpeg/libijg8/jcapimin.c

**** Changes from 2016.11.18 (schlamelcher)

- Added compiler version checks to ofdiag.h etc:
  The compiler diagnostic macros now also check the compiler version and not
  only the compiler itself to ensure the respective features are really avail-
  able. This fixes problems regarding older versions of GCC.
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/diag/mmtag.def

**** Changes from 2016.11.17 (riesmeier)

- Fixed warning re. overloaded virtual function:
  Fixed a compiler warning regarding an overloaded virtual function hiding the
  print() method from the base class. Could be reproduced using gcc with option
  -Woverloaded-virtual.
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrdoctr.h
           dcmsr/libsrc/dsrdoctr.cc

**** Changes from 2016.11.17 (onken)

- Avoid warning regarding hidden virtual method.
  Affects: dcmiod/include/dcmtk/dcmiod/iodreferences.h

**** Changes from 2016.11.17 (eichelberg)

- Removed unnecessary call to getBaseTag().
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcitem.cc

**** Changes from 2016.11.16 (schlamelcher)

- Added some missing files to the install steps:
  Added the new files under dcmtk/ofstd/diag to the install steps for both
  CMake and Autoconf.
  Added docs/CHANGES.XXX to the install steps for both CMake and Autoconf.
  Affects: CMakeLists.txt

  value representation. The occurance of such DICOM datasets in the
  field, using OW and undefined length, was reported by Jörg Weinert in
  October 2016.

**** Changes from 2016.11.16 (riesmeier)

- Fixed wrong reference to conventonal JPEG format.
  Affects: dcmjpls/docs/dcmjpls.dox

- Added note/warning on size of class instance:
  Added a note (warning) that an instance of this class requires quite some
  memory. So it is probably better to use the heap space (and not the stack).

- Fixed wrong identation with tab characters:
  Fixed wrong identation with tab characters (mainly introduced with last
  commit). Also changed outdated name of DCMTK module in the comment header
  (was "dcmpstat", actually is "dcmtls").
  Affects: dcmtls/tests/dcmtk_ca.pl

- Replaced tab characters by spaces:
  Replaced tab characters by spaces and removed trailing spaces (introduced
  with the last commit).
  Affects: dcmtls/libsrc/tlslayer.cc

- Replaced non-ASCII characters:
  Replaced Unicode characters by their corresponding ASCII representation
  since the previous encoding resulted in a strange display of the HTML
  Doxgen documentation (in a web browser). Also replaced "(c)" by "(C)"
  where appropriate.

**** Changes from 2016.11.16 (onken)

- Renamed min() to min2() (macro name clash):
  Renamed the method min() to min2() since min() is also a macro on Windows
  systems which can lead to a name clash in user code.

  Affects: ofstd/tests/tlimits.cc

**** Changes from 2016.11.15 (schlamelcher)

- Suppressed some unnecessary warnings:
  Suppressed overflow warnings in OFnumeric_limits' unit test, since it is the
  overflow behavior that is being tested there.
  Suppressed Clang warnings about mixing struct/class keywords in the pre C++11
  implementation of OFtuple since mixing those keywords has no drawbacks and
  allows writing more compact code.
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/oftuple.h
           ofstd/tests/tlimits.cc

- Added macros for controlling compiler diagnostics:
  Introduced platform independent macros for controlling compiler diagnostic
  output i.e. warning messages.

- Use macro _LIBICONV_VERSION instead of variable:
  Use macro _LIBICONV_VERSION instead of global variable _libiconv_version
  in OFCharacterEncoding::getLibraryVersionString(). Both should be defined
  in the main header file "iconv.h"... but apparently are not (always).
  Affects: ofstd/libsrc/ofchrenc.cc

**** Changes from 2016.11.11 (riesmeier)

- Added "Simplified Adult Echo SR" to known types:
  Added the Simplified Adult Echo SR IOD / SOP Class, which was introduced
  only recently with Supplement 169, to the list of known (but not yet
  supported) SR document types.
  Full support for this IOD / SOP Class will follow in a future commit.

- Updated dcmtls and dcmpstat to compile with OpenSSL 1.1.0:
  Updated the dcmtls and dcmpstat modules, which now compile
  and work with OpenSSL 1.0.0, 1.0.1 and 1.1.0. Removed support
  for some historical, insecure export ciphersuites in TLS.
  NOTE: OpenSSL 1.1.0 does not anymore accept certificates
  with MD5 message digest in TLS connections.
  This means that certificates generated with previous versions
  of the dcmtk_ca.pl script will no longer work for TLS.
  The script has been updated accordingly.

- Updated dcmsign to correctly compile with OpenSSL 1.1.0:
  Updated the dcmsign module so that it compiles and works with
  OpenSSL 1.0.0, 1.0.1 and 1.1.0. Implemented support for
  SHA256, SHA384 and SHA512 as additional message digest
  algorithms for DICOM signatures.

**** Changes from 2016.11.10 (schlamelcher)

- Enhanced C++11 compliance of OFvariant:
  Moved a type definition from the inside of a constexpr function to the
  enclosing class, since this is only allowed by C++14 and later but not C++11.
  Fixed potentially too weak alignment specifier used while determining the
  common alignment of all variant alternatives.

**** Changes from 2016.11.04 (riesmeier)

- Made "ReportType" optional in XML Schema:
  Made "type" attribute optional for "report" element in XML Schema. This
  is because the readXML() of the DSRDocument class does not require it
  (in fact, it does not even use it).
  Also fixed a wrong name for one of the "ReportType" enumerations.
  Affects: dcmsr/data/dsr2xml.xsd

- Removed check on arrays being not a null pointer:
  Removed comparison of char arrays being not equal to a null pointer since this
  is always true. This fix should avoid warning messages reported by Clang 3.5.
  Affects: dcmpstat/libsrc/dviface.cc

**** Changes from 2016.11.03 (riesmeier)

- Added support for missing "ReportType" values:
  Over the years, support for various new DICOM SR IODs has been added to
  the "dcmsr" module but the XML Schema was not updated in this regard.
  Now, the list of "ReportType" enumerated values is again up-to-date.
  Affects: dcmsr/data/dsr2xml.xsd

- Added support for InstanceCreatorUID to readXML():
  Added missing support for the InstanceCreatorUID to readXML().
  The writeXML() already supported this optional XML attribute.
  Affects: dcmsr/libsrc/dsrdoc.cc

**** Changes from 2016.11.01 (riesmeier)

- Added readXML mode that accepts empty/missing UID:
  Added new mode to readXML() that accepts empty or missing Study/Series/
  SOP Instance UID values in the input document. This is required if only
  some of these three UID values should be re-generated (replaced). Now,
  option --generate-new-uids (with --dont-overwrite-uids) works as expected.
  Thanks to Martin Wenger <Martin.Wenger@klinikum-hef.de> for the original
  report that resulted in this improvement/fix.
  Affects: dcmsr/apps/xml2dsr.cc
           dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrtypes.h

           dcmsr/libsrc/dsrtypes.cc
           dcmsr/libsrc/dsrxmld.cc

- Output debug messages when updating attributes:
  Output messages to the debug logger when updating DICOM header attributes,
  especially when generating new Study / Series / SOP Instance UIDs.
  Affects: dcmsr/libsrc/dsrdoc.cc

- Made clear that options +/-Uo require +Ug:
  Now it is checked whether option --generate-new-uids (+Ug) is used when
  --overwrite-uids (+Uo) or --dont-overwrite-uids (-Uo) is also specified
  on the command line. This should avoid possible confusions.
  Affects: dcmdata/apps/xml2dcm.cc
           dcmsr/apps/xml2dsr.cc

- Fixed a problem with a previous commit:
  A line in a previous commit was truncated, leading to compiler errors.
  Affects: dcmpstat/libsrc/dviface.cc

**** Changes from 2016.10.28 (schlamelcher)

- Fixed using third party libraries with MinGW:
  Modified 3rdparty.cmake such that MinGW is handled the same as Unix like
  systems regarding the integration of third party libraries.
  Affects: CMake/3rdparty.cmake

- Fixed 32 vs. 64 bit problem in dcmqrdb:
  Fixed incompatibility of dcmqrdb databases between 32 bit and 64 bit code on
  the same platform. Don't forget to re-create your databases using dcmqridx.
  Affects: dcmqrdb/include/dcmtk/dcmqrdb/dcmqridx.h

- Several fixes for dcmpstat:
  Fixed detecting structured reporting objects based on the SOP class.
  Fixed print job execution and cleanup. Print job executing was bugged when
  the name of one print job was a prefix to the name of another print job.
  Fixed deadlock in instanceReviewed() regarding database access.
  Fixed opening files named using non ASCII characters (only relevant on
  Windows).
  Affects: dcmpstat/apps/dcmprscu.cc
           dcmpstat/libsrc/dviface.cc
           dcmpstat/libsrc/dvpshlp.cc

- Fixed wrong usage of checkStringValue() in dcmpmap:
  Fixed passing the attribute type to checkStringValue() where the value multi-
  plicity is expected.
  Affects: dcmpmap/libsrc/dpmmodparametricmapimage.cc

**** Changes from 2016.10.12 (riesmeier)

- Added comment on recently added DICOM attributes:
  Added comment on DICOM attributes that were recently added to the DICOM
  standard but which are not (yet) supported by the "dcmsr" module.
  As usual, these "things to be done" can be found by searching for "tbd:"
  in the source code of this module.
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrcodvl.h

**** Changes from 2016.10.04 (schlamelcher)

- Fixed a problem in OFtuple's constructor:
  GCC 6.2.1 wasn't able to compile OFtuple's constructor, which is fixed in
  this commit.
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/oftuple.h

**** Changes from 2016.09.22 (riesmeier)

- Added new DCMTK modules "dcmtract" and "dcmpmap":
  These two (still pretty new) modules were missing in the README file.
  Also updated description of "dcmsr" module in order to be consistent
  with the Doxygen file.
  Affects: README

**** Changes from 2016.09.21 (onken)

- Make Manufacturer type 2, consistency fixes:
  Thanks to Jörg Riesmeier for the hint and proposed patch.

**** Changes from 2016.09.20 (riesmeier)

- Disable two test cases when building shared libs:
  Temporarily disable two new test cases when building shared libraries
  because of unresolvable linker errors (static member "EmptyItem" not
  found).
  See DCMTK Bug #694.
  Affects: dcmsr/tests/Makefile.dep
           dcmsr/tests/tsrlist.cc

**** Changes from 2016.09.19 (riesmeier)

- Fixed compiler warnings on unused variables:
  Fixed compiler warnings on unused variables reported by Visual Studio 2010.
  Affects: dcmjpls/libcharls/intrface.cc

- Fixed linker errors on non-gcc platforms:
  Fixed linker errors on non-gcc platforms that occurred after adding new
  "dcmsr" test cases (which make use of the class DSRListOfItems).
  Affects: dcmsr/tests/tsrlist.cc

**** Changes from 2016.09.17 (riesmeier)

- Added missing source file (new test cases):
  Added new source file that was missing for the previous commit.
  Added:   dcmsr/tests/tsrlist.cc

**** Changes from 2016.09.16 (hasenpusch)

- Fixed include paths in DCMTK's package config file:
  Fixed exporting wrong module include paths inside generated DCMTKConfig.cmake.
  The specified module include paths went two levels too deep into the folder
  hierarchy, leading to system include shadowing under certain circumstances.
  This fixes DCMTK bug #692.
  Thanks to forum user jakecobb for reporting this bug.
  Affects: CMake/DCMTKConfig.cmake.in

**** Changes from 2016.09.16 (riesmeier)

- Enhanced template class DSRListOfItems:
  Added new methods addItems() and getItems() to the template class
  DSRListOfItems. These new methods expect a vector as a parameter
  and thus allow for adding/getting multiple items with a single call.
  Closes DCMTK Feature #572.
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrtlist.h
           dcmsr/tests/CMakeLists.txt

**** Changes from 2016.09.15 (schlamelcher)

- Further fixes for OFvariant:
  OFvariant's copy constructor and assignment operator are now disabled for
  types that can not be converted to one of the variant's alternatives (using
  OFenable_if).
  Fixed OFvariant's fallback implementation for systems that do not provide
  memory alignment facilities.
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/variadic/variant.h

**** Changes from 2016.09.14 (riesmeier)

- Fixed minor issues in modules' documentation:
  Fixed minor issues in modules' documentation of "dcmpmap" und "dcmtract".
  Some of these are related to Doxygen (the tool that is used for generating
  the rendered output) and some have been fixed for reasons of consistency
  with other DCMTK modules.
  Affects: dcmpmap/docs/dcmpmap.dox
           dcmtract/docs/dcmtract.dox

**** Changes from 2016.09.14 (schlamelcher)

- Fixes for OFvariant, dcmiod, dcmseg and dcmpmap:
  Removed DLL export macros from several template classes as this does not seem
  to work for templates.
  Introduced a workaround for older C++ compilers regarding base class
  definitions in derived classes, e.g. OFvariant<int,char> will not be available
  as OFvariant (without the template parameters) in derived classes on these
  compilers. OFvariant and DcmIODImage now define the types 'variant' and
  'IODImage' resp. instead, which may be used in derived classes for referring
  to the resp. base class or one of its methods etc.

- Trying possible fix for OFvariant vs DLLs.
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/ofutil.h
           ofstd/libsrc/ofstd.cc

**** Changes from 2016.09.12 (riesmeier)

- Updated coding scheme designator (CP-1567):
  Updated coding scheme designator for CID 5000 (Languages) based on recently
  approved CP-1567: The designator changed from "IETF4646" to "RFC5646".
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/cmr/cid5000.h
           dcmsr/libcmr/cid5000.cc

- Added support for recently approved CPs:
  Added support for CP-1418 and CP-1586 to the data dictionary.
  These CPs were approved during last week's DICOM WG-06 t-con.
  Also fixed an attribute name change in "dcmrt" due to retirement.

           dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dcdeftag.h
           dcmdata/libsrc/dcdictbi.cc

**** Changes from 2016.09.10 (onken)

- Corrected value checking and setters for VM > 1:
  Some value checks have been filling the VM parameter incorrectly by providing
  the value type (like "1C") instead, leading to an error if value checking is
  not disabled.
  Thanks to Andrey Fedorov <andrey.fedorov@gmail.com> for the bug report.
  Also, some type of values (e.g. Floating Point Value) allow more than one
  value which is now possible using an optional parameter in the related setter()
  method.
  Affects: dcmiod/include/dcmtk/dcmiod/iodcontentitemmacro.h
           dcmiod/libsrc/iodcontentitemmacro.cc

**** Changes from 2016.09.05 (onken)

- Fixed typos and other enhancements.
  Affects: dcmpmap/docs/dcmpmap.dox

**** Changes from 2016.09.02 (onken)

- Make sure setValueType() sets correct string value:
  Due to a copy/paste error setValueType() has constantly set the value "CODE"
  instead of the value provided by the user.
  Affects: dcmiod/libsrc/iodcontentitemmacro.cc

**** Changes from 2016.09.01 (onken)

- Remove default value for first parameter:
  Remove default value for first method parameter in constructor
  since otherwise Visual Studio moans that it overlaps with the
  default constructor (which is undefined and private, though).
  Affects: dcmiod/include/dcmtk/dcmiod/iodmacro.h

- Introduced new module dcmpmap for Parametric Maps:
  The new dcmpmap module offers an API for creation, loading, accessing and
  saving DICOM Parametric Map objects as introduced in DICOM Supplement 172.
  All binary data types supported by the standard (16 bit signed and unsigned
  integer as well as 32 bit and 64 bit floating point data) are handled by the
  library.

- Updated code definitions for DICOM 2016c:
  Updated automatically generated code definitions of "DCM" coding scheme for
  the latest release of the DICOM standard, i.e. DICOM 2016c. All other coding
  schemes are not updated since there were no changes or the header files are
  not (yet) generated automatically.
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/codes/dcm.h

- Updated data dictionary for DICOM 2016c edition:
  Updated data dictionary for the latest edition of the DICOM standard, which
  has been released on 2016-06-10. Since DCMTK's data dictionary was already
  up-to-date regarding the recently approved Supplements and CPs, there are no
  changes apart from the "Version" column.

**** Changes from 2016.06.09 (onken)

- Corrected error from merging in tractography code.
  Affects: dcmiod/libsrc/iodtypes.cc

- Modifier Code Sequence exchangable:
  Very often in DICOM as combination of a code with modifiers is used. The
  modifiers are often stored in the Modifier Code Sequence. However, sometimes
  another sequence is used for the same purpose. For those cases the sequence
  being used in the CodeWithModifiers class has been made configurable.
  Affects: dcmiod/include/dcmtk/dcmiod/iodmacro.h
           dcmiod/libsrc/iodmacro.cc

**** Changes from 2016.06.08 (onken)

  Added new module dcmtract that offers a dedicated API to create and read DICOM
  Tractography Results objects as introduced in DICOM Supplement 181. The commit
  also includes enhancements and minor fixes for the dcmiod and dcmfg modules.

**** Changes from 2016.05.31 (riesmeier)

- Added codes introduced with recently approved CPs:
  Added new "DCM" codes introduced with the recently approved CP-1543
  (PET image library corrections).
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/codes/dcm.h

- Made use of DateTime consistent in concept names:
  Implemented changes introduced with CP-1545 (Make use of DateTime consistent
  in concept names), which was approved as Final Text only recently.
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/codes/dcm.h
           dcmsr/libcmr/tid1600.cc

- Added support for recently approved CPs:
  Added support for CP-1031 and CP-1539 to the data dictionary.
  These CPs were approved during this weeks WG-06 meeting.
  Affects: dcmdata/data/dicom.dic
           dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dcdeftag.h
           dcmdata/libsrc/dcdictbi.cc

**** Changes from 2016.05.24 (riesmeier)

- Added size of DICOM dataset to transfer entry:
  Added information on the size of the dataset (in bytes) to the transfer entry,
  i.e. to the list of SOP instances to be transferred. Also added a new notifier
  method that is called _before_ a SOP instance is transferred. This allows for
  implementing a more accurate progress bar in a derived class.
  Affects: dcmnet/include/dcmtk/dcmnet/dstorscu.h
           dcmnet/libsrc/dstorscu.cc

**** Changes from 2016.05.13 (riesmeier)

- Avoided recursion in DB_FreeUidList():
  Replaced recursive call in DB_FreeUidList() by a while loop in order
  to fix a possible issue (crash) when freeing a very long UID list.
  Thanks to Stacy Loesch <Stacy.Loesch@varian.com> for the report.
  Affects: dcmqrdb/libsrc/dcmqrdbi.cc

**** Changes from 2016.05.03 (riesmeier)

- Updated latest tested CMake version:
  Updated information on latest CMake version that has been tested to "3.5.2".
  Affects: CMake/dcmtkPrepare.cmake

**** Changes from 2016.04.27 (riesmeier)

- Enhanced return value of determineStartFragment():
  Enhanced error conditions returned by DcmCodec::determineStartFragment().
  This avoids getting a meaningless EC_IllegalCall when trying to access a
  particular frame of a compressed and fragmented pixel data element, e.g.
  if the basic offset table is empty. This is particularly reasonable since
  the codec rountines are usually hidden to the user of the toolkit, e.g. by
  the DicomImage class.
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dcerror.h
           dcmdata/libsrc/dccodec.cc
           dcmdata/libsrc/dcerror.cc

- Removed unused local function:
  The (local) function dcmErrorConditionToString() is not used any longer,
  so remove it from the source file.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcerror.cc

**** Changes from 2016.04.25 (schlamelcher)

- Removed definition of Visual Studio macro NOMINMAX:
  A previous commit introduced the definition of NOMINMAX inside osconfig.h to
  fix problems regarding the min()/max() functions declared as part of
  OFnumeric_limits. However, this is problematic for users that declare
  NOMINMAX themselves or don't want to declare NOMINMAX at all.
  This commit removes the NOMINMAX definition from osconfig.h and modifies
  OFnumeric_limits and related header files in a way that they may be included
  without the need to declare NOMINMAX. The NOMINMAX macro is then only defined
  when compiling the DCMTK itself, DCMTK users may or may not declare NOMINMAX
  themselves as needed/appropriate.
  Thanks to Peter Klotz <Peter.Klotz@ith-icoserve.com> for the report.

  Thanks to Peter Klotz <Peter.Klotz@ith-icoserve.com> for the report.

- Updated code definitions for DICOM 2016b:
  Updated automatically generated code definitions of "DCM", "NCIt" and "UMLS"
  coding scheme for the latest release of the DICOM standard, i.e. DICOM 2016b.
  The other coding schemes like "SRT" or "UCUM" are not updated since their
  header files are not (yet) generated automatically.

- Updated data dictionary for DICOM 2016b edition:
  Updated data dictionary for the latest edition of the DICOM standard, which
  has been released on 2016-04-01. Since the data dictionary was already
  up-to-date regarding the recently approved Supplements and CPs, there are no
  changes apart from the "Version" column.

**** Changes from 2016.04.06 (schlamelcher)

- Fixed some configuration tests for VS2015 and later:
  Some changes in the runtime of Visual Studio 2015 and later lead to false
  configuration test results regarding some secure printf functions
  (e.g. vsprintf_s).
  Thanks to DCMTK forum user Shaeto for providing related information and the
  suggested patch.
  Affects: CMake/GenerateDCMTKConfigure.cmake

- Fixed a problem with yesterday's commit:
  The previous commit regarding ofmath.cc resp. math.cc contained a copy and
  paste error leading to problems under Windows.
  Affects: config/math.cc

**** Changes from 2016.04.05 (schlamelcher)

- Fixed a warning and some whitespace errors:
  Fixed a warning about an uninitialized variable and some whitespace errors in
  oflog (timehelp.cc).
  Affects: oflog/libsrc/timehelp.cc

- Refactored OFMath/arith.cc dependencies:
  Moved ofmath.cc to the config module (with slight modifications) so arith.cc
  depending on it becomes less messy.
  Added a new ofmath.cc for ofstd, adapting between both APIs (the low level
  API used in config and the one provided by ofstd).
  Modified arith.cc as necessary.
  Added:   config/math.cc
  Affects: config/arith.cc
           ofstd/libsrc/ofmath.cc

**** Changes from 2016.03.31 (schlamelcher)

- Fixed touching arith.h on every CMake cache rebuild:
  Regarding the CMake setup, the file config/arith.h is now only generated once
  during the initial cache setup, similar to the other configure tests only
  being run once.
  This may potentially miss changes induced by changed compiler flags, however,
  this is of course also a problem regarding all the other configure test and
  should be addressed some time in the future in general.
  Affects: CMake/GenerateDCMTKConfigure.cmake

**** Changes from 2016.03.21 (riesmeier)

- Replaced EC_InvalidTag by EC_MissingAttribute:
  Now using more appropriate status code EC_MissingAttribute instead of
  EC_InvalidTag when checkExistsWithValue() fails for Type 1 attributes.
  This change should have no effect to user code (internal use only).
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcddirif.cc

**** Changes from 2016.03.04 (riesmeier)

- Check for PixelSpacing in SharedFunctionalGroups:
  Also check for the Pixel Spacing (0028,0030) attribute in the Pixel Measures
  Sequence (0028,9110) of the Shared Functional Groups Sequence (5200,9229).
  By doing so, non-square pixels are supported for the family of Enhanced
  Multiframe Image IODs, too.
  Please note that support for Pixel Spacing within the Per-frame Functional
  Groups Sequence (5200,9230) is still missing.

  Affects: dcmfg/libsrc/fgimagedatatype.cc

**** Changes from 2016.02.24 (riesmeier)

- Fixed possible issue in OFStandard helper function:
  Fixed possible issue in OFStandard::removeRootDirFromPathname() that could
  occur when passing a NULL pointer as the "rootDir" parameter, and thus
  calling strncmp() or wcsncmp() with an invalid value. This is mainly a
  theoretical scenario, since most implementations of these standard string
  functions will not crash when a 0 length value is passed at the same time
  (see test case "ofstd_OFStandard_removeRootDirFromPathname").
  This possible issue has been found with Pareon Verify.
  Thanks to Andrei Terechko <andrei@vectorfabrics.com> for the report.
  Affects: ofstd/libsrc/ofstd.cc

- Fixed memory leak in ASC_addPresentationContext():
  Memory of presentation context data structure was not freed when empty
  transfer syntax list was passed to ASC_addPresentationContext(). Also
  removed an unused local variable and fixed various typos in comments.

  Added comment on the mapping of code meanings to a compiler-friendly
  representention, which is the reason why the SRT and UCUM coding schemes
  are not yet complete (with regard to the definitions in DICOM PS 3.16).
  Please note that the commit message for the previous commit (168662c)

**** Changes from 2016.02.18 (riesmeier)

- Added three new Storage SOP Classes from DICOS:
  Added three new Storage SOP Classes from DICOS (Digital Imaging and
  Communications in Security) standard: 2D AIT, 3D AIT and Quadrupole
  Resonance (QR). Actually, these SOP Classes were already introduced
  to the DICOM standard back in 2013 but have been added to the DCMTK
  just now. Further details on the underlying IODs are not known.

  (within the "movescu" tool). These SOP Classes were added during the
  previous months to the global list stored in "dcmAllStorageSOPClassUIDs".
  Affects: dcmnet/docs/movescu.man

  Changed type of parameter/variable from Uint32 to size_t in order to avoid
  warnings reported by MSVC++ on Windows 64-bit systems.

- Fixed issue with shared library build (MSVC++):
  Fixed issue with shared library build on Windows with Microsoft Visual C++.
  Now, the CMake option BUILD_SHARED_LIBS works again on both Linux with gcc
  and Windows with Visual C++, i.e. for ".so" and ".dll" files.
  C++ templates with explicit specialization and shared library support are
  really a nightmare, especially when the implementation of the C++ template
  class is not completely contained in a header file.
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrdncsr.h
           dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrtncsr.h

- Enhanced support for by-reference relationships:
  Further enhanced support for by-reference relationships: Now, the position
  string that is used to reference the target content item is also generated
  correctly when the document tree contains included (i.e. non-expanded)
  sub-templates. Also enhanced the existing test cases in order to check that
  it really works.
  Please pay attention to the new comment on updateByReferenceRelationships()
  and to the optional parameter that allows for updating subtrees managed by
  "included template" tree nodes.

- Further simplified DSRDocumentSubTree::print():
  Further simplified implementation of DSRDocumentSubTree::print() by making
  use of the new DSRIncludedTemplateNodeCursor class. Also added a new print
  flag that disables the counting of "included template" nodes. This flag is
  also passed to the tree node cursor class in order to correctly generate
  the position string.

- Added methods to get external cursor to root node:
  Added two methods that allow for getting an (external) cursor to the root
  node of the document tree, either an instance of DSRDocumentTreeNodeCursor
  or an instance of the recently introduced DSRIncludedTemplateNodeCursor.
  These cursors can be used to iterate over the nodes of the document tree
  without changing the internal cursor.

- Introduced new document tree node cursor:
  Introduced new DSRIncludedTemplateNodeCursor class, which allows for
  iterating "included template" tree nodes as if the subtree managed by
  them was already expanded. This will make iteration over such document
  trees much easier (but the implementation looks a bit more complex).
  This new class is just a specialization of the existing, but now also
  extended, C++ template class DSRTreeNodeCursor, which has received a
  second template parameter for this purpose.

  references. Now, a question mark "?" is printed if the position string

  Added getCurrentNode() method to document (sub)tree class. This new method
  allows for accessing the current tree node by means of a (constant) pointer,
  i.e. read-only. Also added a new test case for this particular method.

- Enhanced check for invalid characters:
  Now, the static function checkStringValue() - and all methods that use it -
  check for invalid characters in the given value. Currently, this only works
  for ASCII strings (default character repertoire) that contain non-ASCII
  characters, i.e. character codes > 127.
  This change requires that the Specific Character Set value is passed to the
  respective function/method since the default is ASCII (as it was before).

**** Changes from 2016.02.11 (onken)

- Fixed use of checkStringValue():
  For some VR classes (DcmLongText, DcmShortText, DcmUnlimitedText) the method
  checkStringValue() expects the character set as the second parameter and not
  the VM as it is the case for most other VR classes. The related calls in
  dcmiod, dcmfg and dcmseg did not respect this deviating API, thus requiring
  the given fix which disables the value checking.

- Restructured print() output of included templates:

- Overwrite isShort() in DSRIncludedTemplateTreeNode:
  Overwrite isShort() method in class DSRIncludedTemplateTreeNode. Since the
  base class DSRDocumentTreeNode always returns OFTrue, it makes sense to
  check the content in the derived tree node class. Of course, rendering a
  document tree with "included templates" is currently not supported, so the
  isShort() method is probably never really used in this context.

- By default, convert wide char encoding to UTF-8:
  Changed default value of parameter "convert" for both the constructor and
  the set() method of the OFFilename class, which expects a "wchar_t *", from
  "OFFalse" to "OFTrue". That means, a character string that is passed with
  Windows UTF-16 encoding will be converted to UTF-8 (char *) encoding. This
  change of the default behavior makes sense since e.g. the output of an
  OFFilename instance to the logger always happens with UTF-8 encoding.
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/offile.h

- Fixed documentation of convertToWideCharString():
  Fixed documentation of parameter "toString" of convertToWideCharString():
  the value of this result variable might only be NULL if memory is exhausted.
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/ofchrenc.h

**** Changes from 2016.02.04 (riesmeier)

- Changed print() output of included SR templates:
  Slightly changed the output of the print() method for "included template"
  tree nodes: The line indentation and output of the position counter is now
  also shown for this "internal" node (and not only for the included subtree);
  the position counter is increased by 1 as it is true for all other tree
  nodes, which makes it easier and more consistent when determining the target
  of by-reference relationships. However, there is still some work to do...
  Also, the separate line for the included SR template (starting with the text
  "# INCLUDE ...") is now printed by default. Therefore, the name of the print
  flag changed from PF_printXXX to PF_hideXXX.

- Further enhanced checkSubTreeConstraints():
  Added initial support for "included templates" to checkSubTreeConstraints().
  At least, subtrees with included SR templates are not rejected any longer.
  However, since no further checks are performed, a message is reported to the
  trace logger.
  Also added a new test case in order to check whether "included templates" are
  really accepted when inserting a sub-template into a root template (with an
  appropriate IOD constraint checker enabled).

  template that is managed by this document tree node class.

- Use addContentItem() for by-value relations only:
  Made clear that addContentItem() should be used for by-value relationships
  only. This is now also checked and a new test case makes sure that it works.
  Furthermore, do not accept the internal value type VT_includedTemplate for
  this method. All this is checked by the helper method canAddContentItem().

  to the derived template classes. All these methods are "constant", i.e. they
  do not change the object.

- Enhanced support for by-reference relationships:
  Further enhanced support for by-reference relationships, e.g. by restoring
  these type of relationships on a clone of the document (sub)tree. Also report
  details to the debug logger if adding a by-reference relationship fails (for
  some reason). Finally, added an initial version of a new test case that should
  make sure that by-reference relationships work with "included templates".

  anymore not to declare the getParentNode() method "const". So just do it.
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrtncsr.h

  Added "const" version of top() method to OFStack class as it is defined
  for the standard (STL) class std::stack. Also fixed various documentation
  related issues.
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/ofstack.h

- Removed unneeded type definitions for Windows:
  Removed unneeded type definitions introduced for calling functions from the
  "SNMP Utility Library" (snmpapi.dll) on the Windows operating system.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcuid.cc

- Fixed issue with getMACAddress() on Windows 8++:
  Fixed issue with getMACAddress() on some Windows 8 (and newer) systems.
  Removed unneeded call to SnmpExtensionQuery() that caused a crash on such
  systems.
  Thanks to forum user "andreasb" for the report and suggested fix, and to
  forum user "Rich in Soquel" for confirming that this fix also solves an
  issue on Windows 10.

**** Changes from 2016.01.30 (riesmeier)

- Extracted expandIncludedTemplates() method:
  Extracted code from createExpandedSubTree() for the new protected method
  expandIncludedTemplates(). This new method might be used in the future for
  expanding the current (sub)tree, i.e. without creating a new one.

- Overwrite print() method in document tree class:
  Overwrite print() method from base class (DSRDocumentSubTree) in document
  tree class in order to hide additional parameter(s) on the main API level.

- Further enhanced support for included templates:
  Enhanced support for included (non-expanded) templates in print() method of
  document (sub)tree class. Now, the position counter of nested content items
  also works correctly for these "virtual" content items (i.e. with included
  subtrees). Also the complexity of the print() method code could be reduced.

  i.e. elements with an attribute tag of the group 0x0000 to 0x0003, 0x0005,
  0x0007 or 0xFFFF. Now, for both file meta information header and dataset
  a warning is reported.

- Fixed issue with addPersonObserver() in TID 1001:
  Fixed issue when calling addPersonObserver() in TID1001_ObservationContext
  for the first time _after_ addDeviceObserver() has already been called.
  According to the SR template specification, the person observers always have
  to be stored at the beginning of the subtree of the SR template, i.e. the
  root node changes in such a case. Modified the test case accordingly.
  Also see previous commit that fixes an issue on the basic tree class.

  adding a node or subtree before the root node of the current tree. Added
  new test case in order to make sure that this never happens again.
  This issue has been found when adding a "Device Observer" before a "Person

  Added support for new value representation "Other Long" (OL) that has been
  introduced only recently with Supplement 181 (Tractography Results Storage
  SOP Class).
  Closes DCMTK Conformance #664 (partially).

- Made use of isAffectedBySpecificCharacterSet():
  Use isAffectedBySpecificCharacterSet() instead of checking the VRs that
  are affected by the specific character set manually. This should make sure
  that new VRs are not forgotten (like in this case "UC").
  Affects: dcmdata/apps/xml2dcm.cc

- Changed name of dcmEnableXXX global variables:
  Changed name of global variable dcmEnableOtherFloatStringVRGeneration and
  dcmEnableOtherDoubleStringVRGeneration: removed the term "String" from the
  names. This change should be harmless since most people will probably use
  the global function dcmEnable/DisableGenerationOfNewVRs() - if at all.
  Also see commit 280638e.

- Fixed wrong use of getVM() in print() method:
  Since the derived class DcmOtherDouble always has a value multiplicity of 1
  getVM() cannot be used to determine the number of values stored. So, use
  the length field instead (as in other similar cases).
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcvrfd.cc

**** Changes from 2016.01.21 (onken)

- FormatMessage() instead of hand-crafted switch():
  Use FormatMessage() in order to get an error code description instead of
  enumerating all string values in a switch() statement. Made Unix strerror()
  call thread-safe by using OFStandard version. Fixed typo.
  Affects: dcmnet/libsrc/diutil.cc

- Enhanced API documentation:
  Slightly enhanced API documentation on class DSRTreeNodeCursor.
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrtncsr.h

- Removed empty source file for DSRTreeNodeCursor:
  Removed empty source file for the DSRTreeNodeCursor class. The
  implementation of the template class has been moved to the header file
  with commit 6171318. Some linkers complained about the empty file.

  internal value type VT_includedTemplate. This might be useful for debugging
  purposes.
  Affects: dcmsr/libsrc/dsrtypes.cc

- Fixed issue with definition of E_ValueType:
  When the new (internal) value type VT_includedTemplate was introduced,
  the indicator for the last entry in the enum (VT_last) has not been
  updated. This impacted the various valueTypeToXXX() helper functions.

**** Changes from 2016.01.20 (onken)

- Removed accidentially checked-in test code.
  Affects: dcmnet/apps/dcmrecv.cc

- Better logging of select() on network:
  When waiting for network data using select() it has not been distinguishable
  whether a regular timeout occurred or if another error (such as an interrupt)
  interrupted the call. Now, debug output is written in order to make it easier
  to see what exactly happened (especially in case of errors).

  Affects: dcmiod/include/dcmtk/dcmiod/iodutil.h

- Avoid warning when initialzing srand():
  Some systems report a warning when using time_t to initialize srand().
  A cast was added which should be safe since we are not interested into
  the exact number time() returns but in a "random" initialization value.
  Affects: dcmiod/tests/tcielabutil.cc

**** Changes from 2016.01.19 (riesmeier)

- Enhanced error checking of writeXML() method:

  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcpxitem.cc

**** Changes from 2016.01.14 (riesmeier)

- Fixed memory leak reported by valgrind:
  Fixed memory leak ("still reachable blocks" at program exit) that was reported
  by valgrind in CMR_ContentMappingResource::cleanupAllContextGroups(). Instead
  of cleanup() the initialize() function was called for the CID 7469 class.
  Affects: dcmsr/libcmr/init.cc

- Used CMR_SRNumericMeasurementValue more often:
  Replaced type of numeric value parameters in public API from class
  DSRNumericMeasurementValue by derived class CMR_SRNumericMeasurementValue
  which provides additional checks, e.g. on the code used for the optional
  value qualifier (CID 42).

- Added support for recently added Context Groups:
  Added support for recently added Context Group CID 6147, 7181, 7464 and 7469.

  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/cmr/tid1500.h

- Made sure file is processed by Doxygen:
  Made sure that the header file is processed by Doxygen since it contains
  some interesting (and also documented) global variables/settings. Fixed
  a couple of typos and other minor issues related to the documentation.
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dcobject.h

- Replaced call of isValid() by isComplete():
  Replaced call of DSRCodedEntryValue::isValid() by the recently introduced
  isComplete() method where appropriate. Also fixed a couple of wrong calls of
  addChildContentItem() instead of addContentItem(), which makes no difference
  for an empty document tree anyway.

  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrimgvl.h

- Enhanced check on Segmentation objects:
  Enhanced check on DICOM Segmentation objects that are referenced by an
  instance of DSRImageReferenceValue. On the one hand, the list of known
  Storage SOP Classes has been updated for the latest edition of the
  DICOM standard (2015c); the Surface Segmentation object was missing.
  On the other hand, the list of referenced segment numbers is only allowed
  for Segmentation objects, which is now also checked.

- Harmonized log output of DICOM attribute names:
  Don't mix keywords (CamelCase) with attribute names anymore. Always use the
  official attribute names in log messages, i.e. with space characters. Of
  course, this only applies to manually written messages. In case the name
  is derived automatically from the attribute tag, the official keyword from
  the DICOM data dictionary (PS 3.6) is used.

- Added initial version of NCIt code definitions:
  Added initial version of the NCI Thesaurus (Coding Scheme "NCIt") code
  definitions as used/defined by the DICOM standard.
  The code definitions are generated semi-automatically from the machine-readable
  DocBook/XML version of DICOM PS 3.16 (DICOM Content Mapping Resource). That
  means that the definitions will be updated from time to time as the standard
  evolves. However, please be warned that the names of the constants/defines
  might change in the future (hopefully, there will be official keywords in the
  standard like they are for the DICOM attribute tags in PS 3.6).

- Allowed public access to referenced template:
  Allowed public access (get and set method) to the referenced template that
  is managed by the class DSRIncludedTemplateTreeNode. That way, there is no
  need any more for the inelegant "friend" declaration. Also the API is now
  more consistent with other "node" classes, even though this class is used
  only for internal purposes.

**** Changes from 2016.01.11 (riesmeier)

- Fixed another issue with createExpandedSubTree():
  When an empty "included template" content item was processed, i.e. removed
  from the resulting document tree, the next content item was skipped by
  mistake. This was detected when enhancing a test case for the upcoming
  support of TID 1411 (which is included in TID 1500 - Row 8).

  Affects: dcmsr/libsrc/dsrdocst.cc

- Avoid checking the pointer returned by getNode():
  Avoid checking the pointer returned by getNode() method if it is clear that
  it cannot be NULL, e.g. because the internal cursor has already been checked
  for validity or a previous call of an iteration method returned a non-zero
  value.

- Enhanced derived implementation of countNodes():
  Enhanced implementation of countNodes() in derived document tree classes by
  providing two optional flags that allow for specifying how to count
  and process "included templates", e.g. whether the content of included (but
  not expanded) sub-templates is counted like a normal subtree with all of its

- Fixed typo in error message.
  Affects: dcmfg/libsrc/fginterface.cc

- Fixed bug when packaging binary segmentations:
  Segmentations bits are filled into the byte from right to left, i.e. starting
  from the least significant bit of the first byte to the most significant bit
  of the last byte in the Pixel Data element. The old implementation filled the
  bytes in the correct order, however, the bits have been filled in from the
  wrong order. This was discovered since another implementation was available for
  interoperability testing.

- Added support for CID 6147, 7181, 7464 and 7469:
  Added support for Context Group CID 6147 (Response Criteria), CID 7181
  (Abstract Multi-dimensional Image Model Component Units), CID 7464 (General
  Region of Interest Measurement Modifiers) and 7469 (Generic Intensity and
  Size Measurements), which will be needed for using the upcoming template
  class of TID 1411 (Volumetric ROI Measurements) within TID 1500 (Measurement
  Report). As always, all these new files were generated automatically.

- Added new method hasExtendedCodedEntries():
  Added new method hasExtendedCodedEntries() to the context group base
  class, which allows for checking whether the group has any extended,
  i.e. non-standard coded entries. Also changed two virtual functions
  to "inline" (as it was intended).

- Introduced new printExtended() method:
  Extracted output of extended information on a content item from the general
  print() method of the DSRDocumentSubTree class and moved this code to the
  new printExtended() method of the DSRDocumentTreeNode class. In other words,
  the resulting output is the same but the internal structure is now clearer.

  Replaced wrong call of gotoLastEntryFromNodeList() by gotoEntryFromNodeList().
  In practice, this should make no difference but now the correct function is
  called.
  Affects: dcmsr/libcmr/tid1500.cc

**** Changes from 2016.01.06 (riesmeier)

- Added full support for qualitative evaluations:
  Added full support for qualitative evaluations (TID 1500 - Row 13 and 14),
  e.g. for categorial observations that are related to the entire subject of
  the report rather than specific measurement groups (DICOM PS 3.16).

- Added new method isComplete() to coded entry class:
  Added new method isComplete() to DSRCodedEntryValue, which checks whether
  the three mandatory components of a code are non-empty. This is a much more
  basic check than isValid() provides.

- Added new condition constant and fixed memory leak:
  Introduced new condition constant that is used when no image library entry
  descriptors have been added (i.e. copied from a given dataset). Also fixed
  a possible memory leak that could occur in such a case.
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/cmr/tid1600.h
           dcmsr/libcmr/tid1600.cc

- Added new parameter to gotoLastEntryFromNodeList():
  Added optional parameter "firstPos" to gotoLastEntryFromNodeList(), which
  allows for stopping the search process at a particular node list entry.

  Added optional "check" parameter to convenience methods addContentItem()
  and addChildContentItem().
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrdocst.h
           dcmsr/libsrc/dsrdocst.cc

- Enhanced hasXXX() by adding an optional parameter:
  Enhanced hasImagingMeasurements() and hasQualitativeEvaluations() by adding
  an optional parameter that allows for checking whether the respective content
  item has any children (i.e. real content). Since the child nodes are optional
  the default is not to check for children.

- Slightly reworked use of xxx_RESULT helper macros:
  Introduced new helper macros GOOD_RESULT and BAD_RESULT. Replaced helper
  macro DELETE_ERROR by an appropriate use of the new macro BAD_RESULT.
  In general, used the helper macros more often in order to increase the
  readability of the source code.

  Affects: dcmsr/libcmr/srnumvl.cc

- Added preliminary support for TID 1500 - Row 12:
  Added preliminary support for the conditional CONTAINER content item
  "Qualitative Evaluations" (TID 1500 - Row 12), which seems to be required
  according to the condition given in the template definition table. Support
  for the child content items (CODE and TEXT) will follow in a separate commit.

- Added initial version of UMLS code definitions:
  Added initial version of Unified Medical Language System (Coding Scheme
  "UMLS") code definitions as used/defined by the DICOM standard.
  The code definitions are generated automatically from the machine-readable
  DocBook/XML version of DICOM PS 3.16 (DICOM Content Mapping Resource). That
  means that the definitions will be updated from time to time as the standard
  evolves. However, please be warned that the names of the constants/defines
  might change in the future (hopefully, there will be official keywords in the
  standard like they are for the DICOM attribute tags in PS 3.6).

- Added links to implemented SR templates:
  Added links to the currently implemented SR templates to the Doxygen
  documentation of the "dcmsr" module.
  Affects: dcmsr/docs/dcmsr.dox

- Added 1st version of TID 1500 (Measurement Report):
  Added first version of TID 1500 (Measurement Report) and included templates.
  The focus of this initial commit was on the general structure of this SR
  template and the mandatory content items and included templates (TID 1204,
  1001, 1600). There is also a new test case that demonstrates how to use the
  new TID1500_MeasurementReport class. Further enhancements will follow.

- Used another document type for a test case:
  Used another document type for the test case "dcmsr_changeDocumentType_2" in
  order to avoid a warning message that the template identification is not set.
  Affects: dcmsr/tests/tsrdoc.cc

- Added further output methods to template classes:
  Added write(), writeXML() and renderHTML() method to template-related classes.

- Print the annotation text for included templates:
  As for all other types of content items, the optional annotation text is now
  also printed for the internal "included template" type.
  Affects: dcmsr/libsrc/dsrtpltn.cc

- Call clear() method of both base classes:
  Made sure that the clear() method of both base classes is called, i.e. also
  DSRTemplateCommon::clear() which clears the internally managed node list.
  Affects: dcmsr/libsrc/dsrrtpl.cc

- Avoid calling getSelectedValue() explicitly.
  Affects: dcmsr/libcmr/tid1001.cc

**** Changes from 2015.12.30 (riesmeier)

- Added support for expanding a document tree:
  Added support for expanding a document tree, i.e. to replace all included
  templates by their content (i.e. the subtree that is managed by the class).
  Also added a new test case that uses (and checks) this new feature.

           dcmsr/tests/tsrtpl.cc

- Added support for including templates into a tree:
  Added support for including - not inserting - templates into a document tree
  or subtree. That means, the template-specific API is still available to the
  user even though the tree structure that is managed by the template class
  has been "inserted" into a (sub)tree. In order to achieve this, a new value
  type (internal) has been added: VT_includedTemplate. Further related changes
  will follow.

- Included standard header "assert":
  Added missing standard header "assert.h" or "cassert" in order to compile
  when HAVE_STL and HAVE_STD_STRING are defined. This header file is needed
  for Linux systems with gcc (and probably others).
  Also fixed some typos and Doxygen related issues.
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/ofstd.h

**** Changes from 2015.12.28 (riesmeier)

- Added support for replacing a node in a tree:
  Added support for replacing the current node (and all of its child nodes)
  of a tree by a given node (which might be the root of a subtree). This new
  feature is needed for the upcoming enhanced SR template support.

- Added mapping resource to IOD constraint checker:
  Replaced getRootTemplateIdentifier() by getRootTemplateIdentification()
  which returns the mapping resource in addition to the identifier of the
  root template (if any). Before, the DICOM Content Mapping Resource (DCMR)
  was implicitly assumed when calling the getRootTemplateIdentifier() method.

  This change should make no difference since the method where this function
  is called always checks whether the requested entry exists in the list of
  node IDs.
  Affects: dcmsr/libcmr/tid1600.cc

- Disable Visual Studios min()/max() macros:
  The DCMTK version of min() and max() defined in oflimits.h n conflicts with the
  Visual Studio versions that are pre-defined in Windows. Thus, they are now
  disabled in a Visual Studio build.
  Affects: CMake/osconfig.h.in

- Moved math functions from OFStandard to OFMath:
  Commit 1b6bb7 added oflimit.h dependency to ofstd.h in order to implement some
  new methods in OFStandard. However, oflimits.h relies on arith.h which is
  created very early by arith.cc in a special build step. However, arith.cc
  already relies on ofstd.h so a circular dependency was created. This has been
  fixed by moving those functions (isnan and isinf) into an new class "OFMath"
  which is declared in a separate header file ofmath.h. Before, ofstd.h defined
  the functions and ofmath.cc already implemented them as part of OFStandard.
  Thus the methods also moved from class OFStandard to OFMath.

- Further enhanced implementation of TID 1600:
  Further enhanced implementation of TID 1600 (Image Library), e.g. since this
  template is extensible, the structure of content items might deviate from
  the definition in DICOM PS 3.16 (Content Mapping Resource). Also there is
  now a way of recreating the root content item of this template after the
  clear() method has been called.

- Fixed possible underflows and overflows:
  At several places in the code a wrong length of ACSE data structures received
  over the network can cause overflows or underflows when processing those
  data structures. Related checks have been added at various places in order
  to prevent such (possible) attacks.
  Thanks to Kevin Basista for the report.

  to non-initialized memory. Also fixed extraction of binary segmentation frames
  for some objects. Fixed typo.

- Added set() methods for various template rows:
  Added new methods that allow for setting various modality-specific content
  items manually. At the moment, only some content items for TID 1607 (Image
  Library Entry Descriptors for PET) are supported. Further items will follow.

- Added new function gotoNamedChildNode():
  Added new helper function gotoNamedChildNode() which sets the internal cursor
  of the document (sub)tree to a named node starting from the first children of
  the current node. This avoid calling multiple other functions and checking of
  return values.

- Added new functions getCursor() and setCursor():
  Added new protected helper functions getCursor() and setCursor(), which can
  be used to store and reset a particular cursor position within a derived
  class (e.g. one of the SR template classes). This is much more efficient
  than iterating over the tree and searching for a particular node ID.

- Fixed issue with some binary segmentations:
  Some binary segmentation objects, whose number of pixels are not dividable by
  8, could not be correctly read or written since the standard requires to not
  have any unused bits between the frames when encoding them in the Pixel Data
  element. The corresponding routines have been re-written to reflect this
  requirement. Thanks to Andrey Fedorov <andrey.fedorov@gmail.com> and David
  Flade <fladedavid@gmail.com> for the report.

- Handle EINTR raised by connect() or select():
  The EINTR error (system call was interrupted by a signal that was caught)
  might also be raised by a call of connect() or select(), which was not yet
  handled appropriately.
  Thanks to Thomas Sondergaard <thomas.sondergaard@karoshealth.com> and
  Alexander Karaivanov <alexander.karaivanov@karoshealth.com> for the report
  and suggested fix.
  Affects: dcmnet/libsrc/dulfsm.cc

- Check return value of listen() for errors:
  Introduced check of return value of listen() call in order to detect e.g.
  when listening on a certain port that is already in use (EADDRINUSE).
  This kind of error has been reported for various Linux distributions,
  e.g. RHEL5.3 and CentOS 7.
  Thanks to Thomas Sondergaard <thomas.sondergaard@karoshealth.com> and
  Alexander Karaivanov <alexander.karaivanov@karoshealth.com> for the report
  and suggested fix.

**** Changes from 2015.12.04 (riesmeier)

- Added comment on optional elements to be supported:
  Added comment on optional data elements to be supported in the future.
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrdoc.h

- Fixed wrong cardinality check on type 2 sequence:
  Fixed wrong cardinality check on type 2 element Performed Procedure Code
  Sequence (0040,A372). The DICOM standard says: "Zero or more Items shall
  be included in this Sequence."
  Affects: dcmsr/libsrc/dsrdoc.cc

**** Changes from 2015.12.01 (riesmeier)

- Updated documentation on recently added VR "UC":
  Updated documentation regarding the value representation (VR) "Unlimited
  Characters" (UC), which was missing at various places, especially when
  listing the VRs that are affected by Specific Character Set (0008,0005).

**** Changes from 2015.11.25 (onken)

- Replaced type "bool" through "OFBool":
  Some occurrences of bool have been checked in by one of the last commits
  (72538a3). Since bool is not used in DCMTK so far (except for code integrated
  from external sources), it was replaced by the DCMTK-specific OFBool type.

**** Changes from 2015.11.18 (onken)

- Add operators "<", "<=", ">" and ">=" for dcmdata:
  Added operators "<", "<=", ">" and ">=" for DcmElement and DcmItem classes in
  dcmdata in order to allow comparison of elements or items (i.e. lists of
  elements). The operators use the compare() functions introduced several weeks
  ago. Also fixed doxygen documentation issue.

- Added minimal support for Supplement 187:
  Added minimal support for the recently approved Supplement 187 (Preclinical
  Small Animal Imaging Acquisition Context), i.e. added new Storage SOP Class
  to "dcmdata", "dcmnet" and "dcmqrdb". Also added new SR document type to
  "dcmsr". Full support for this new Structured Rreporting IOD will follow in
  a future commit.
  The official status of this Supplement is "Draft Final Text - Waiting for
  Codes" (WC), i.e. the document is final but some machine-readable codes are
  still missing.

- Added DICOMDIR support for Supplement 184:
  Added support for new Storage SOP Class from Supplement 184 (Brachytherapy
  Delivery Instruction) to DICOMDIR generation code.
  Also fixed a minor issue with the "RT Beams Delivery Instruction Storage"
  SOP Class in this context.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcddirif.cc

- Use tag constants for better readability.
  Affects: dcmdata/tests/tvrcomp.cc

- Print warning when overwriting an existing file:
  Make sure that movescu and getscu print out a warning when storing a received
  file using a filename that is already taken by an existing file. This resulting
  behaviour (warning and overwriting the old file) is now consistent with
  storescp.
  Affects: dcmnet/apps/movescu.cc

**** Changes from 2015.11.13 (riesmeier)

- Added support for further Asian character sets:
  Added support for further Asian character sets, e.g. Thai, Japanese, Korean
  and Chinese (including ISO 2022 code extensions). The character set mapping
  that is used for HTML/XHTML and XML format is based on Table D-1 in DICOM PS
  3.18 Annex D (current version from Supplement 174 - RESTful Rendering).

  --charset-assume, are checked. This will facilitate the addition of new
  character sets (in the future).
  Affects: dcmsr/apps/dsr2html.cc
           dcmsr/apps/dsr2xml.cc

- Support multiple values for SpecificCharacterSet:
  Added support for multiple values being used for Specific Character Set
  (0008,0005). This will allow for specifying ISO 2022 based character sets
  as needed for Japanese, Korean and Chinese (i.e. code extensions).
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrdoc.h

  ENABLE_BUILTIN_DICTIONARY. Now it is consistent with other similar macros.
  Affects: config/docs/macros.txt

**** Changes from 2015.11.13 (onken)

- Renamed some handle...() methods for consisteny:
  The handle...() methods for FIND, MOVE and ACTION only receive the
  corresponding message but do not handle them further (e.g. they do not send
  a response). Thus the methods have been renamed to "receive...()" following
  the scheme already used for the STORE message before.

  Rows (0028,0010) and/or Columns (0028,0011) is missing.
  Affects: dcmimgle/libsrc/diimage.cc

**** Changes from 2015.11.09 (riesmeier)

  Fixed segment access via Segment Number which now assumes that the first
  Segment Number is not 0 as in the underlying vector, but starts with 1.
  Thanks to Andrey Fedorov <andrey.fedorov@gmail.com> for the report.
  Affects: dcmseg/libsrc/segdoc.cc

**** Changes from 2015.10.09 (riesmeier)

- Check further dependence of command line options:
  Made sure that option --attr-template-id is only used together with option
  --write-template-id, i.e. check the same dependence as for option
  --template-envelope. This is because --attr-template-id would have no effect
  otherwise, which might be unexpected to the user.
  Affects: dcmsr/apps/dsr2xml.cc

**** Changes from 2015.10.08 (riesmeier)

- Added guard to fix issue with llvm-gcc-4.2:
  Added guard to fix linker error with llvm-gcc-4.2 on Mac OS X. This guard
  checks for the use of a Clang compiler, which requires explicit template
  instantiation (see commit a3dc5b5) while other compilers do not.
  Thanks to Bill Lorensen <bill.lorensen@gmail.com> for the report and

- Fixed issue with Clang 3.0/3.1 on Mac OS X:
  Fixed linker error with Clang 3.0/3.1 on Mac OS X with support for "shared
  libs" enabled. These older versions seem to require explicit instantiation
  of the template class DSRTree<DSRDocumentTreeNode>, which serves as the
  base class of DSRDocumentSubTree.

**** Changes from 2015.09.25 (riesmeier)

- Updated comments for TID 1607:
  Updated comments for TID 1607 (Image Library Entry Descriptors for PET)
  based on feedback and a proposed CP from David Clunie.
  Affects: dcmsr/libcmr/tid1600.cc

- Fixed code meaning for UCUM code "deg":
  Fixed code meaning for UCUM code "deg" (based on a proposed CP from David
  Clunie, editor of the DICOM standard).
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/codes/ucum.h

- Made static method checkSOPInstance() virtual:
  Made static method checkSOPInstance() virtual so derived classes can
  overwrite (specialize) it. Also added a comment explaining this.
  Affects: dcmnet/include/dcmtk/dcmnet/dstorscu.h

- Fixed possible memory leak:
  Made sure that all locally allocated memory is freed before returning from
  a method with an error status. This possible memory leak was found in
  DcmSCU::sendSTORERequest().
  Affects: dcmnet/libsrc/scu.cc

- Report an error if DICOM file cannot be loaded:
  Report an error to the log output if a SOP instance to be sent (i.e. which
  is part of the transfer list) cannot be loaded from the referenced DICOM file.
  Affects: dcmnet/libsrc/dstorscu.cc

- Changed API to use OFFilename instead of OFString:
  Changed type of parameter of some methods that take a filename to use an
  instance of OFFilename instead of OFString. This allows for passing also
  a wide character string (on Windows) as well as a C string.
  This is an onging process, so further API changes may follow.

- Fixed incorrect header and comments:
  The helper functions were extracted from the DcmStoragesSCU class, so the
  copyright header and comments were not correct. Also the name of the DCMTK
  module was incorrect (it is "dcmdata" and not "dcmiod").
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dcdatutl.h
           dcmdata/libsrc/dcdatutl.cc

- Fixed automatically generated CHANGES entry.
  Affects: docs/CHANGES.361

- Removed suffix "String" from "Other..." VRs:
  Supplement 181 (Tractography Results Storage SOP Class) introduces a new
  value representation (VR) "Other Long" (OL) and, thereby, removes the suffix
  "String" from all "Other..." (Ox) VRs.

  Added the new DCMTK modules dcmfg, dcmiod and dcmseg to the README file.
  Affects: README

**** Changes from 2015.09.18 (riesmeier)

- Fixed order of modules in main HTML file:
  The order of DCMTK modules in the main HTML documentation file was almost
  alphabetical. Now, the order should be as it always was intended.
  Affects: doxygen/htmldocs.dox

- Fixed various minor issues in module descriptions.
  Affects: dcmfg/docs/dcmfg.dox
           dcmiod/docs/dcmiod.dox
           dcmseg/docs/dcmseg.dox

- Updated currently supported compiler versions:
  Updated compiler versions for Linux and Windows operating system usually
  supported by the current development version (aka "snapshot").
  Affects: INSTALL

- Check for recently approved multi-frame images:
  Updated check for multi-frame images regarding some recently approved
  multi-frame image IODs (i.e. their associated SOP Class UIDs), which were
  missing. Also added a comment explaining that it is not always clear what
  DICOM PS 3.11 (Media Storage Application Profiles) means with "multi-frame
  Media Image Storage SOP Classes" and similar descriptions.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcddirif.cc

**** Changes from 2015.09.17 (onken)

- Enable private tags in builtin dictionary on CMake:
  CMake did not allow the use of the private tag option together with the builtin
  dictionary. Since that combination works fine, this restriction was removed.
  Affects: CMake/dcmtkPrepare.cmake

- Fixed another typo.
  Affects: CMake/dcmtkPrepare.cmake

- Fixed typo and made documentation more consistent.
  Affects: config/configure.in
           config/docs/macros.txt

- Fixed typo in CMake script that can cause warnings.
  Affects: CMake/dcmtkPrepare.cmake

**** Changes from 2015.09.16 (onken)

- Simplified builtin dictionary infrastructure:
  DCMTK has three mechanisms to populate its global data dictionary, one of them
  being the builtin dictionary that is compiled into the object code. Now, always
  dcdictbi.cc is used as source for the builtin dictionary. dcdictzz.cc as well
  as various make targets are not required any more.
  mkdictbi.cc and mkdeftag.cc can still be used to re-create dcdictbi.cc and
  dcdeftag.h respectively (the latter containing tag constants). New make targets
  updatebuiltindict and updatedeftag compile those tools and create the new
  source code based on dicom.dic and private.dic.
  Further details can be found in dcmdata/docs/datadict.txt

**** Changes from 2015.09.15 (onken)

- Renamed dictionary configuration build options:
  Renamed the configuration option used for enabling or disabling builtin
  dictionary, external dictionary and automated loading of the external private
  dictionary private tag. The build configuration options are now called
  enable/disable instead of with/without since the later is only to be used for
  configuring support for external packages like ZLIB or OpenSSL. Also fixed
  some typos.

- Added "YXLON" to the new CREDITS file.
  Affects: CREDITS

**** Changes from 2015.09.11 (riesmeier)

- Added CREDITS file:
  Added CREDITS file that contains a list of individuals, companies and
  organizations we would like to thank for supporting the development and
  maintenance of the DCMTK. Of course, this list is not (yet) complete but
  will be extended over time.
  Added:   CREDITS
  Affects: CMakeLists.txt

**** Changes from 2015.09.03 (onken)

- Use static_cast instead of dynamic_cast:
  In DCMTK there is a rule not to use dynamic_cast at all even if it is
  already available in the toolkit via OFdynamic_cast. Thus all calls have
  been replaced with OFstatic_cast calls instead.

**** Changes from 2015.09.02 (riesmeier)

- Introduced global definitions for certain tags:
  Introduced global definitions for Item and Sequence Delimitation Item tags
  where the (internal) VR is already passed to the DcmTag constructor.
  Using these definitions avoids the time-consuming VR lookup. This improves
  the performance when parsing DICOM objects with very large SQ elements (i.e.
  sequences with thousands of items like in many Enhanced Multi-frame IODs).
  Also renamed the global definitions of "ItemTag" and "InternalUseTag", which
  now also have the common "DCM_" prefix, and passed (internal) VR to them.
  Furthermore, introduced definitions for Pixel Item and Pixel Sequence, which
  makes the source code more readable.

**** Changes from 2015.09.01 (riesmeier)

- Check logger for debug output of template tree:
  Check whether the debug logger is enabled (instead of the define "DEBUG") when
  printing the contents of the template tree to the console.
  Added:   dcmsr/tests/gmon.out
  Affects: dcmsr/tests/Makefile.dep
           dcmsr/tests/tsrcmr.cc

- Removed version suffix "3" from dictionary entries.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcdict.cc

- Added comment that "Big Endian" is retired:
  Added comment that the "Explicit VR Big Endian" transfer syntax has been
  retired. This is mainly for reasons of consistency with the other retired
  transfer syntaxes that are defined in this header file.
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dcuid.h

**** Changes from 2015.08.28 (riesmeier)

- Fixed "cardinality" for SQ elements in comments:
  Fixed value of "cardinality" for SQ elements in comments ("1-n" for "one or
  more items" instead of "1" as it was before).
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrdoc.h

- Fixed various issues in test case:
  Fixed various issues in test case "dcmnet_dimseDump_nullByte", e.g. use the
  attribute Affected SOP Instance UID instead of Patient's Name for the UI
  element in the C-ECHO Request message. Also changed order of parameters in
  OFCHECK_EQUAL() call.
  Affects: dcmnet/tests/tdump.cc

- Made sure that "dicom.dic" is loaded for tests:
  Made sure that the data dictionary that is shippped with the DCMTK is loaded
  before the test cases in the "dcmnet" module are started. This prevents that
  some tests fail if the VR (and/or the attribute name) of particular tags are
  unknown.
  Affects: dcmnet/tests/Makefile.in

**** Changes from 2015.08.28 (onken)

- Added more files to be ignored by git:
  Added "*.*~" since it is used by some editors for temporary files.
  Affects: .gitignore

**** Changes from 2015.08.27 (onken)

- Added shared library export maro to IODModule:
  The shared library export macro was missing for the IODModule class which
  triggered (at least) warnings in Visual Studo 2010.
  Affects: dcmiod/include/dcmtk/dcmiod/modbase.h

**** Changes from 2015.08.27 (riesmeier)

- Made sure that tree node annotations are copied:
  Made sure that tree node annotations are copied/cloned when a copy or clone
  of a tree node or a (sub)tree is created. This makes sure that the additional
  textual information (e.g. a user-defined label or the template ID/row number)
  is also available in the copy/clone. As always: enhanced existing test cases.
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrtree.h
           dcmsr/libsrc/dsrdoctn.cc

- Added support for Context Group CID 100 and 7021:
  Added support for Context Group CID 100 (Quantitative Diagnostic Imaging
  Procedures) and CID 7021 (Measurement Report Document Titles), which will
  be needed for the upcoming template class of TID 1500 (Measurement Report).

**** Changes from 2015.08.26 (riesmeier)

- Added support for annotating content items:
  Added support for textual annotations, which can be used to label content
  items with user-defined information. This might facilitate the navigation
  within the document tree and is especially useful for document structures
  based on templates. Therefore, the template classes in the "cmr" (Content
  Mapping Resource) submodule annotate all content items with a predefined
  text of the format "TID xxxx - Row nn".

- Avoid seperator if time component is empty:
  Avoid separator between date and time component of a "DateTime" value if the
  latter is empty. Before, there was a trailing space in the resulting string.
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dcvrdt.h
           dcmdata/libsrc/dcvrdt.cc

- Extracted general information from template:
  Extracted general information on template into local macros (#defines).
  The same approach is already used for the context group classes. Also
  made sure that the "type" of the template (extensible or non-extensible)
  is set.

- Slightly changed conversion operator:
  Slightly changed conversion operator of context group class that returns
  the currently selected coded entry value. The new version of this operator
  avoids the creation of an unwanted copy.
  Also added new tests to check whether the conversion operator actually works.
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrctxgr.h
           dcmsr/tests/tsrcmr.cc

**** Changes from 2015.08.26 (onken)

- Build flags for internal and external dictionary:
  Introduced build flags for controlling whether DCMTK will use an internal,
  compiled-in and/or an external dictionary. On Windows systems, a
  built-in dictionary (only) is the default, while on Unix only the external one
  is enabled per default. This behaviour is identical to the old one. It is
  possible to enable both options simultanously; then the built-in is loaded
  first, and the external one is loaded afterwards. More details can be found
  in dcmdata/docs/datadict.txt

**** Changes from 2015.08.25 (riesmeier)

- Added initial version of TID 1600 (Image Library):
  Added initial version of TID 1600 (Image Library) and included templates
  TID 1601 to 1607. Also added a quite comprehensive test for this new template.
  Please note that there are still a few details in the source code that are
  marked with "tbc" (to be checked) or "tbd" (to be done). Also the class
  documentation contains corresponding notes and warns about this fact.
  Acknowledgement: This work has been supported in part by the "QIICR" project.

- Updated Makefile dependencies.
  Affects: dcmsr/apps/Makefile.dep
           dcmsr/libsrc/Makefile.dep

- Introduced type for list of CID 7445 values:
  Introduced type for list of device participating roles (CID 7445).
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/cmr/tid1001.h
           dcmsr/libcmr/tid1001.cc

- Added initial version of SRT and UCUM codes:
  Added initial version of SNOMED-RT (Coding Scheme "SRT") and Unified Code for
  Units of Measure ("UCUM") code definitions. In contrast to the "DCM" codes,
  which were added only recently to the DCMTK, these two new coding schemes only
  consist of those codes that are needed for TID 1600 to 1607 (Image Library).
  Further codes will be added when needed.
  The code definitions are generated semi-automatically from the machine-readable
  DocBook/XML version of DICOM PS 3.16 (DICOM Content Mapping Resource). That
  means that the definitions will be updated from time to time as the standard
  evolves. However, please be warned that the names of the constants/defines
  might change in the future (hopefully, there will be official keywords in the
  standard like they are for the DICOM attribute tags in PS 3.6).

**** Changes from 2015.08.24 (riesmeier)

- Added enhanced versions of CID 10013 and 10033:
  Added derived classes for CID10013_CTAcquisitionType and
  CID10033_CTReconstructionAlgorithm, which provide enhanced functionality,
  e.g. a mapping of Defined Terms to coded entries (from the respective
  context group). These new classes will be needed for TID 1605 (Image
  Library Entry Descriptors for CT).
  Also added new test cases in order to make sure that these classes
  work correctly (i.e. as expected).

  sequence item. These methods are needed to support code modifiers.
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrcodvl.h
           dcmsr/libsrc/dsrcodvl.cc

- Added new optional parameter "vm" to readSequence:
  Added new optional parameter "vm" to the readSequence() method, which allows
  for specifying the expected value multiplicity (i.e. cardinality) of the
  sequence to be read. The default behavior remains the same (i.e. "vm = 1").
  This change will allow for reading code sequences with multiple items, e.g.
  containing modifiers of a higher level coded entry.

- Introduced new modules dcmiod, dcmfg and dcmseg:
  dcmiod is a module that makes it easy to work with common DICOM IOD modules
  and IODs being composed of them. When writing modules it is ensured that
  basic checks are performed regarding the presence of required attributes and
  their values as well as the validity of values. Classes like DcmIODCommon and
  DcmIODImage can be used to derive user-defined classes that implement specific
  DICOM IODs, making it easier to concentrate on the specifics of a particular
  IOD.
  The dcmfg module facilitates working with functional group that have been
  introduced to DICOM in the context of the "Enhanced" family of IOD objects
  that contain multiple frames that are described via shared and per-frame
  functional groups. This class offers a generic interface to create, modify,
  load and store such functional groups. Also, it supports a dozen of
  functional groups directly by offering classes with related getter and setter
  methods.
  Finally, the dcmseg module makes use of dcmiod and dcmfg in order to
  implement an Enhanced DICOM object, the Segmenation IOD. Since most of the
  underlying data elements are already provided by dcmiod and dcmfg, dcmseg
  only consists of a single class and some helpers.

**** Changes from 2015.08.20 (riesmeier)

- Added cleanup() function to context group classes:
  Added static cleanup() function to all context group classes. There is also
  a global cleanupAllContextGroups() function that allows for a "clean" program
  exit, e.g. when using a tool such as "valgrind" to check for memory leaks.
  Also added a new "test case" that cleans up all context groups at the end.

- Added enhanced versions of CID 29, 244 and 4031:
  Added derived classes for CID29_AcquisitionModality, CID244_Laterality and
  CID4031_CommonAnatomicRegions, which provide enhanced functionality, e.g. a
  mapping of Defined Terms or Enumerated Values to coded entries (from the
  respective context group). In contrast to the base classes, these new
  classes are written manually.
  As always: also added new test cases in order to make sure that these classes
  work correctly (i.e. as expected).

  Dose SR IOD, which was introduced with commit 365951ec, is actually used.
  In order to make sure that a constraint checker will never be forgotten
  again for a newly supported SR document type, the "default" case has been
  replaced in the corresponding switch() statement.

  with the previous commit (i.e. PF_indicateEnhancedEncodingMode).
  Affects: dcmsr/apps/dsrdump.cc

  "printInvalid" parameter has been replaced by a more general numeric
  "flags" parameter.

- Added new mode for adding nodes to the tree:
  Added new mode that allows for adding a node (and its subtree) below the
  current node before its first child node (if any). This new mode might be
  useful when inserting nodes (or subtrees) into an existing tree structure.
  For example, this new mode will be used for the upcoming template TID 1600.
  Also added new test cases and enhanced existing ones to check whether the new
  "add mode" works as expected.

  Affects: dcmpstat/libsrc/dviface.cc

**** Changes from 2015.08.17 (riesmeier)

- Added easier method to set a composite reference:
  Added method that allows for setting a composite reference from a given DICOM
  dataset (i.e. using the data element value for SOP Class UID and SOP Instance
  UID). Before, there was a need to call two separate methods for this purpose.
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrcomvl.h
           dcmsr/libsrc/dsrcomvl.cc

- Added general information on coding scheme "DCM":
  Added general information on coding scheme "DCM", i.e. additional defines for
  the name, description and UID that can be used throughout the toolkit. These
  details are extracted automatically from a machine-readable version of the
  DICOM standard (PS 3.16-2015c).
  This is also another step towards supporting further coding schemes.
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/codes/dcm.h

- Added support for Context Group CID 29:
  Added support for Context Group CID 29 (Acquisition Modality) that will be
  needed for the upcoming template class of TID 1602 (Image Library Entry
  Descriptors) according to CP-1468 (Add defined CID for modality in image
  library), which is part of the next voting package (VP)

**** Changes from 2015.08.12 (riesmeier)

- Added check for CID 42 to NUM values:
  Added check for CID 42 (Numeric Value Qualifier) to Numeric Measurement Values,
  i.e. whether the coded entry used for the optional Numeric Value Qualifier Code
  Sequence is contained in the corresponding Context Group. Since support for the
  DICOM Content Mapping Resource has been implemented in an optional extension to
  the DICOM Structured Reporting module "dcmsr" (namely "libcmr"), a new class
  has been derived from DSRNumericMeasurementValue for this purpose. This initial
  implementation can be used as a "template" for similar use cases.
  Also added new test that makes sure that the internal processing is correct.
  This test case also shows how to use the new class.

- Enhanced handling of empty Measured Value Sequence:
  Enhanced handling of Numeric Measurement Values being absent (i.e. both
  Numeric Value and Measurement Unit have an empty value).  This is valid
  according to the DICOM standard and should, therefore, also be supported
  when calling the isValid() or setValue() methods of the class managing
  Numeric Measurement Values in an SR document.  It is recommend but not
  required to specifiy the reason for the absence of the Measured Value
  Sequence (where these values are stored in a DICOM dataset) in the optional
  Numeric Value Qualifier Code Sequence (which is also supported, of course).
  Also added new test that makes sure that the internal processing is correct.

  Modified OFoptional to disable default constructor detection if the compiler
  does not support it and adjusted the unit test accordingly.
  Modified OFrvalue's unit test to workaround a problem with GCC 4.2's obsolete
  rvalue to lvalue reference conversion semantics and added a warning to the

  Added support for Context Group CID 42 (Numeric Value Qualifier), which is the
  Defined Context Group (DCID) to be used for the Numeric Value Qualifier Code
  Sequence, an optional extension of the NUM (numeric measurement) content item.
  Also fixed minor deviations in the comment text of all other Context Groups.
  A new test case for CID 42 shows how the conversion operator, which has been
  introduced with the previous commit, can be used.

- Added conversion operator to context group class:
  Added conversion operator that returns the currently selected coded entry
  value to the context group base class DSRContextGroup. This avoids calling
  the getSelectedValue() method manually in certain cases.

- Fixed building on FreeBSD with C++11 enabled:
  Modified DCMTK_TRY_COMPILE to respect C++11 compiler flags if C++11 was
  enabled.
  Introduced additional configure tests to check for FreeBSD (and OpenBSD)
  specific behavior regarding alignment specifiers.
  Fixed a problem in ofxml.cc where the wrong kind of zero value was used (NULL
  instead of 0).

- Refactored handling of some <cmath> functions:
  Added configure tests to detect wether isinf(), isnan() and finite() are
  declared inside the std namespace or in the global scope. Updated the
  implementation of OFStandard::isinf() and OFStandard::isnan() respectively.
  Moved implementation to new file ofmath.cc and shared this implementation
  for generating arith.h.

- Disable built-in dictionary for CMake Unix builds:
  On Unix, DCMTK is traditionally built without a built-in dictionary that is
  compiled into the binaries, using automake. Instead, the dictionary is read
  during runtime from a well-known file under the installation directory.
  However, this behaviour was not correctly adapted when porting the existing
  CMake build toolchain from Windows to Unix so that using CMake under Unix also
  resulted in a built-in dictionary. This commit makes sure CMake under Unix now
  shows the same behaviour as the existing automake build. In the near future we
  will also add a CMake option to toggle between built-in and file-based
  dictionary.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/CMakeLists.txt

**** Changes from 2015.07.08 (riesmeier)

- Allow for disabling check on "DICOM file format":
  Added new mode that allows for disabling the check on the "DICOM file
  format", i.e. whether the input file contains file meta information
  (as it is required by part 10 of the standard for all DICOM files).
  As it is true for all disableXXXCheck() methods, please use this new mode
  with care. It has been introduced to allow for registering files without
  meta-header to a DICOMDIR, not to be used on a DICOM storage medium but
  for local storage (e.g. as an index for all "DICOM files" that reside in
  a certain directory of the filesystem).
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dcddirif.h
           dcmdata/libsrc/dcddirif.cc

- Consistently use "file-set" and "file format":
  Consistently use spelling "file-set" and "file format" in comments.
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dcddirif.h
           dcmdata/libsrc/dcddirif.cc

- Improved documentation of disableXXXCheck():
  Improved documentation of the various disableXXXCheck() methods by using
  the Doxygen command "@warning" to emphasize that the resulting DICOMDIR file
  will probably violate the rules for the selected application profile.
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dcddirif.h

- Enhanced check on empty dataset:
  Enhanced check on empty dataset by also calling DcmDataset::card(). This is
  required since the previous check "dataset == NULL" was never true (even for
  DICOM files with an empty dataset).
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcddirif.cc

- Fixed issue in OFStandard::combineDirAndFilename():
  Fixed issue with "hidden files" in OFStandard::combineDirAndFilename(). On
  Unix systems, hidden files/directories start with a "." in the file/directory
  name. These names were treated incorrectly by the abovementioned function,
  which caused unexpected behavior when calling searchDirectoryRecursively() on
  a directory that contains hidden files or directories. Also added a new test
  case for this misbehavior.
  Thanks to DCMTK forum user "Paul Groot" for the original report.
  Affects: ofstd/libsrc/ofstd.cc
           ofstd/tests/tofstd.cc

- Added static initialization function (MT-safe):
  Added static initialization function to context group classes in order to
  make sure that the internally managed list of standard coded entries is
  created before it is actually used. This function should be called in case
  of multi-threaded applications (e.g. before any threads are started).

- Updated data dictionary for DICOM 2015c edition:
  Updated data dictionary for the latest edition of the DICOM standard, which
  has been released on 2015-07-04. This includes the new tags from Supplement
  180 as well as those from CP 1321, 1322, 1402, 1411 and 1438.

**** Changes from 2015.07.03 (riesmeier)

- Added first specific Templates and Context Groups:
  Added first specific Template and Context Group classes, namely CID 5000,
  5001, 7445, 7452 and 7453 as well as TID 1001 and 1204. Please note that
  apart from some special cases (like CID 5000 - Languages and CID 5001 -
  Countries) most Context Group classes can be generated automatically from
  a machine-readable DocBook/XML version of DICOM PS 3.16 (DICOM Content
  Mapping Resource) - and this is how it was actually done :-) The above
  mentioned Context Groups are the first examples only.
  The new classes are not part of the "dcmsr" library but contained in a new
  one ("cmr" - Content Mapping resource). This allows one to continue using
  the underlying "dcmsr" classes without linking the overhead of the growing
  "cmr" library to an application (if there is no need to do so).
  The new test cases for some of the Template and Context Group classes show
  how they can be used. Further sophisticated examples will follow.

- Added initial version of DCM code definitions:
  Added initial version of DICOM Controlled Terminology Definitions (Coding
  Scheme "DCM", Version "01"). These code definitions use the simple and
  lightweight DSRBasicCodedEntry class. Also the definitions are no global
  constants but specified with the compiler directive #define. So, there
  should no performance overhead (with initialization at programn start).
  The code definitions are generated automatically from the machine-readable
  DocBook/XML version of DICOM PS 3.16 (DICOM Content Mapping Resource). That
  means that the definitions will be updated from time to time as the standard
  evolves. However, please be warned that the names of the constants/defines
  might change in the future (hopefully, there will be official keywords in the
  standard like they are for the DICOM attribute tags in PS 3.6).

- Added base class for context groups:
  Added base class for context groups. This is for the initial support only.
  Specific context groups from the DCMR (DICOM Content Mapping Resource) will
  follow. The class supports an arbitrary list of coded entries (if the group
  is extensible); it also supports the selection of a particular entry.

- New class for "Basic Coded Entry Attributes":
  Introduced new class for the "Basic Coded Entry Attributes" (according to the
  DICOM standard). This class should be used to define code constants since it
  is a lightweight structure that does not carry any overhead and also does not
  perform any unnecessary checks. Enhanced documentation of existing code class.

- Added support for long code values (CP-1031):
  Added initial support for long code values according to CP-1031. By default,
  the type of a code value (short, long or URN) is determined automatically,
  e.g. when setting the value of a DSRCodedEntryValue instance. However, the
  type can also be specified manually. Please note that for some methods, the
  position of the optional "check" parameter moved after the new "codeValueType"
  parameter. Support for the optional Equivalent Code Sequence (0008,0121) is
  still missing.

- Optionally accept invalid content item values:
  If a certain read flag is set, further violations of the DICOM standard are
  accepted when reading an invalid SR document. For example, when the numeric
  value of a NUM content item violates the maximum length. This might be useful
  in order to make sure that the other information of the content item is read
  (like the measurement unit).

- Added read flag to all readXXX() methods:
  Added "flag" parameter used to customize the reading process of all read() and
  readXML() methods. This will facilitate the handling of incorrectly encoded SR
  documents in the future (by providing corresponding workarounds). Also fixed
  optionality of existing "flag" parameters throughout the SR library.

**** Changes from 2015.03.27 (riesmeier)

- Added further test cases for VR checker.
  Affects: dcmdata/tests/tchval.cc

- Fixed test after after implementing CP-1425:
  Since CP-1425 permits the horizontal tab character for DICOM text VRs, the
  test case "UT-03" needs to be fixed, too. Also added a new test case "UT-04",
  which checks for the (still invalid) vertical tab character,
  Affects: dcmdata/tests/tchval.cc

- Added support for recently approved CP-1425:
  The recently approved CP-1425 permits the horizontal tab character (HT) in
  DICOM's text VRs (LT, ST, UT). Adapted the VR scanner and the character set
  conversion code (handling of additional control character) accordingly.

- Enhanced use of DSRCodingSchemeIdentificationList:
  Added new method that facilitates adding coding schemes with frequently used
  additional information to the list. This avoids calling the various setXXX()
  methods directly after addItem().
  Acknowledgement: This work has been supported in part by the "QIICR" project.

**** Changes from 2015.03.18 (schlamelcher)

- Modified fallback implementation of OFtuple:
  OFtuple's fallback implementation now also works on older versions of GCC.
  It was necessary to implement a workaround for accessing the type of
  template base classes in derived classes without explicitly stating their
  template parameters.

- Fixed a CMake problem with paths containing spaces.
  Affects: CMake/GenerateDCMTKConfigure.cmake

**** Changes from 2015.03.03 (riesmeier)

- Output message to logger on wrong pixel data class:
  Output an error message to the logger in case the internal class used for the
  Pixel Data element has the wrong type when calling chooseRepresentation().
  This is usually caused by a wrong VR for the Pixel Data element (not OB/OW).
  Thanks to forum user "Shaeto" for the original report.

  correctness problem which prevented building under OS X.
  Affects: dcmtls/libsrc/tlslayer.cc

**** Changes from 2015.02.11 (schlamelcher)

- Introduced cross compiling support for Android:
  Worked around some limitations when building for Android, for instance by
  creating some configure tests that detect the absence of some operating
  system functionality and enable existing or new fallback implementations in
  their stead.
  Added assisted cross compiling support to the CMake scripts, using a
  specially adjusted version of an Android toolchain configuration file
  borrowed from the OpenCV project. Also adding some code to (remote-)
  control the Android device emulator (that is part of the official Android
  SDK) and integrate it into the CMake build system. This allows the
  configure- and unit tests to run on the emulated target device.

- Updated data dictionary for DICOM 2015a edition:
  Updated data dictionary for the latest edition of the DICOM standard, which
  has been released on 2015-02-05. Since the data dictionary was already
  up-to-date regarding the recently approved Supplements and CPs, there are no
  changes apart from the "Version" column.

**** Changes from 2015.02.06 (riesmeier)

- Fixed documentation of default TCP buffer length:
  With the previous commit (2423e3d), the default TCP send and receive buffer
  length has been increased from 32K to 64K. This commit now updates the
  documentation of this default value accordingly.
  Affects: config/docs/envvars.txt

**** Changes from 2015.02.05 (schlamelcher)

- Adjusted DCMNET's default socket buffer length:
  The previous default value of 32K was inappropriate for modern hardware,
  the new default will be 64K for now.
  Thanks to Peter Klotz <Peter.Klotz@ith-icoserve.com> for the report and
  suggested patch.
  Affects: dcmnet/libsrc/dul.cc
           dcmnet/libsrc/dulfsm.cc

**** Changes from 2015.02.03 (riesmeier)

- Updated latest tested CMake version:
  Updated information on latest CMake version that has been tested to "3.1.1".
  Affects: CMake/dcmtkPrepare.cmake

- Fixed another CMake 3.1.x quotation issue:
  According to the CMake documentation "CMake 3.1 and above no longer implicitly
  dereference variables or interpret keywords in an if() command argument when
  it is a 'Quoted Argument' or a 'Bracket Argument'" (see CMP0054 for details).
  Commit cbfe0d7 only solved the issues for Unix-style systems. Now, CMake 3.1
  (and above) should also run without any warnings on Windows systems.
  Affects: CMake/dcmtkPrepare.cmake

**** Changes from 2015.02.02 (riesmeier)

- Added missing standard include for assert():
  Added standard include that is missing when compiled with HAVE_STD_STRING and
  HAVE_STL, i.e. without DCMTK's implementations of some C++ standard classes.
  Thanks to Markus Mertens <Markus.Mertens@evkb.de> for the original report.
  Affects: ofstd/libsrc/ofuuid.cc

**** Changes from 2015.01.29 (schlamelcher)

- Fixed some problems regarding DCMTK's C++11 support:
  The GCC Version is now detected employing the same CMake macro as for
  Clang, this works around the missing version suffix of some GCC versions
  when using the previously employed '-dumpversion' argument.
  Fixed evaluating the wrong macro instead of 'DCMTK_USE_CXX11_STL' within
  OFtuple's and OFalign's implementation.
  Fixed problems regarding OFalign's C++11 implementation.
  Modified OFnumeric_limit's unit test to accommodate for some native
  implementation's behavior to set 'is_modulo' to false when it can't
  be guaranteed (e.g. for optimization purposes).

**** Changes from 2015.01.15 (schlamelcher)

- Introduced basic support for assisted cross compiling:
  Currently, assistance for cross compiling is only available when using
  CMake and creating Windows targets utilizing the MinGW cross compiler.
  Configure- and unit tests are executed via Wine, therefore Wine is required
  for the build process and testing.
  Added:   CMake/dcmtkTryRun.cmake
           CMake/dcmtkUseWine.cmake
  Affects: CMake/GenerateDCMTKConfigure.cmake
           CMake/dcmtkMacros.cmake
           CMake/osconfig.h.in
           config/arith.cc

- Fixed possible arith.h generation problem on MinGW:
  MinGW's custom SEH handling macros don't seem to work reliably on every
  MinGW "distribution". Implemented an even dirtier solution not relying
  on these macros and therefore working.
  The detection of some floating point functions like 'isinf' gave wrong
  results for some MinGW "distributions" in the past. This also affected
  the respective implementation inside OFStandard.
  Affects: config/arith.cc
           ofstd/libsrc/ofstd.cc

**** Changes from 2014.12.11 (riesmeier)

- Changed attribute used for the "FD" test:
  Changed attribute used for the Floating Point Double (FD) test from Physical
  Delta X (0018,602C) to Inversion Times (0018,9079) because only the latter
  allows for storing multiple values (value multiplicity = 1-n).
  Affects: dcmdata/tests/tvrfd.cc

**** Changes from 2014.12.10 (riesmeier)

- Added new test case for VR=FD:
  Added new test case for the VR class DcmFloatingPointDouble in order to make
  sure that the revised version of DcmElement::changeValue(), which is e.g.
  used by DcmFloatingPointDouble::putFloat64(), still works as expected.
  Added:   dcmdata/tests/tvrfd.cc

           dcmdata/tests/Makefile.dep
           dcmdata/tests/Makefile.in

- Fixed error handling in changeValue():
  Fixed error handling in method changeValue(), i.e. return an error code in
  case the memory could not be allocated by new[] or loadValue() failed.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcelem.cc

- Fixed error handling in detachValueField():
  Fixed error handling in method detachValueField(), i.e. return an error code
  in case the memory could not be allocated by new.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcelem.cc

- Use "try and catch" block around new[]:
  Use "try and catch" blocks in order to catch the "bad allocation" exception
  thrown by the call of "new" when non-throwing new operator is not available.

**** Changes from 2014.12.02 (schlamelcher)

- Several fixes regarding OFnumeric_limits:
  The initialization state of FLT_ROUNDS is now dumped to DCMTK_ROUND_STYLE
  during configuration, which can then be evaluated in a compile time
  context. This is necessary to conform closely enough to the C++ standard
  as required by clang.
  Mac OS X's special floating point exception control macros are now applied
  on that platform, instead of the GNU POSIX extensions previously employed
  there as well.
  The existence of '_fpclassf' on the Windows platform is now probed
  regarding the linker as well (previously only the compile time presence was
  tested).

**** Changes from 2014.11.27 (onken)

- Documented DCMTK's C++ cast macros.
  It is noted in particular that OFdynamic_cast should not be used in DCMTK.
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/ofcast.h

**** Changes from 2014.11.25 (schlamelcher)

- Introduced OFnumeric_limits:
  The template OFnumeric_limits provides a standardized way to query various
  properties of fundamental types (e.g. the largest possible value for type
  int is OFnumeric_limits<int>::max()).
  OFnumeric_limits is compatible to C++11's std::numeric_limits.

**** Changes from 2014.11.24 (riesmeier)

- Added support for new UIDs from DICOM 2014c:
  Added support for new SOP Class UIDs from Supplement 171 (Unified Procedure
  Step by REpresentational State Transfer Services) and Supplement 172
  (Parametric Map Storage). Also updated name of well-known UPS SOP instance.

  Completion Flag is not "COMPLETE" for X-Ray Radiation Dose SR objects.
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrdoc.h
           dcmsr/libsrc/dsrdoc.cc

**** Changes from 2014.11.13 (riesmeier)

- Fixed wrong validation of PN, LO and SH values:
  According to DICOM PS 3.5, the control characters LF, FF and CR are not
  allowed for LO and SH element values. Also ESC is only allowed for ISO 2022
  encoding (escape sequences), but not for the default character set (ASCII).
  Affects: dcmwlm/libsrc/wlds.cc

- Fixed typo in comment.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcchrstr.cc

**** Changes from 2014.11.07 (riesmeier)

- Removed unneeded header include:
  The standard header "cassert" is not needed any longer. So do not include it.
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/ofcond.h

**** Changes from 2014.11.06 (riesmeier)

- Fixed issue when scaling certain images:
  The image scaling methods expandPixel() and reducePixel(), which are used for
  interpolation (c't algorithm), were not working correctly for certain sizes.
  This commit solves an issue that was originally fixed with commit e9c3550,
  but now in a more general and probably more robust manner.
  Thanks to Tilman Vogel <tilman@circlecvi.com> for the original report and
  suggested fix.
  Affects: dcmimgle/include/dcmtk/dcmimgle/discalet.h

**** Changes from 2014.11.01 (riesmeier)

- Added "data correction" options to findscu:
  Added two new options that enable/disable the automatic data correction (e.g.
  removal of trailing padding) to the findscu command line tool. The default
  is still to disable the data correction, i.e. the same behavior as before.
  Thanks to forum user "gerhardh" for the original report.
  Affects: dcmnet/apps/findscu.cc
           dcmnet/docs/findscu.man

**** Changes from 2014.10.31 (riesmeier)

- Updated "dcmrt" classes based on DICOM 2014b:
  Updated automatically generated IOD and sequence c++ classes for the various
  RT objects based on the current edition of the DICOM standard (2014b). This
  time, the official DocBook/XML version has been be used (previously, it was
  an unofficial version of the DICOM 2007 standard edition).
  Please note the "known issues" that are documented in the module description.

- RLE images should not use multiple fragments:
  Made it clearer that the DICOM standard does not allow for storing the pixel

**** Changes from 2014.10.09 (schlamelcher)

- Several fixes and additions for yesterday's commits:
  Guarded remaining friend comparison operators of OFoptional via
  OFenable_if. This should finally fix the faulty overload resolution
  problem in Visual Studio.
  Worked around a limitation in MinGW where const objects could not have
  external linkage.
  Corrected template-recursion related problem in OFtuple that prevented
  compiling with Clang.

**** Changes from 2014.10.08 (schlamelcher)

- Small fixes for a previous commit about OFtuple:
  Removed unnecessary additions to the Doxygen configuration file for
  manpages.
  Added OFtuple's testcase to the autoconf configuration.
  Added 'Purpose' statement to OFtuple's header file.
  Affects: doxygen/manpages.cfg
           ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/oftuple.h
           ofstd/tests/Makefile.in

- Introduced move emulation for pre C++11 compilers:
  C++11's move semantics allow more efficient parameter and especially
  return value passing then before. The implemented emulation allows to use
  the primary functionality of move semantics in pre C++11 compilers in a way
  that automatically translates to the appropriate C++11 syntax when C++11
  support is enabled via 'DCMTK_USE_CXX11_STL'.
  The only class utilizing move semantics so far is OFunique_ptr, where move
  semantics are essential to allow using OFunique_ptr objects as parameters
  or return values.
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/ofmem.h
           ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/ofutil.h
           ofstd/tests/tmem.cc

- Introduced OFtuple implementing generic tuples:
  OFtuple is a fixed-size collection of heterogeneous values. It can be
  regarded as a generalization of OFPair.
  OFtuple is similar to C++11's std::tuple and can be replaced by
  std::tuple via enabling 'DCMTK_USE_CXX11_STL'.

- Modified some of OFoptional's comparison operators:
  All comparison operators with an OFoptional object as left hand side
  argument are now implemented as member methods instead of friend functions.
  This is meant to reduce incorrect overload lookup in some Visual Studio
  compilers.
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/ofoption.h

- Fixed a problem in storescp:
  Storescp aborts if it cannot create files in its working directory.
  This behavior is intended, but it should be omitted if the "--ignore"
  flag was set, which is realized by this commit.
  Thanks to Peter Klotz <Peter.Klotz@ith-icoserve.com> for the suggestion.
  Affects: dcmnet/apps/storescp.cc

- Introduced DcmOutputBufferStream::filled() method:

**** Changes from 2014.09.30 (schlamelcher)

- Fixed a bug in dcmdata:
  Refactoring dcmdata to use unsigned types where possible caused problems
  for some index comparisons. Solved by using iterators instead of indexed
  access.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcdict.cc
           dcmdata/libsrc/dcuid.cc

**** Changes from 2014.09.26 (riesmeier)

- Use new VR "UR" for Pixel Data Provider URL:
  Use new VR "UR" (instead of "UT") for the Pixel Data Provider URL (0028,7fe0)

  because the VR of this attribute changed with CP-1324 (see commit 79c499a).

**** Changes from 2014.09.25 (riesmeier)

- Enhanced rewriting rules in DcmVR::getValidEVR():
  Enhanced rewriting rules in DcmVR::getValidEVR() by mapping post-1993 VRs like
  "UT" to "UN" instead of "OB" if possible (i.e. if not disabled as well).
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dcvr.h
           dcmdata/libsrc/dcvr.cc

- Added functions to enable/disable post-1993 VRs:
  Added global functions that allow for enabling and disabling the value
  representations (VRs) that have been introduced after the first edition of
  the DICOM standard (1993) with a single call. These new functions make it
  easier to maintain the various command line tools that use the corresponding
  global flags, e.g. dcmEnableUnlimitedTextVRGeneration.

  for the report and suggested patch.
  Affects: oflog/include/dcmtk/oflog/config/win32.h

**** Changes from 2014.08.18 (schlamelcher)

- Refined definition of numeric types and traits:
  Introduced OFlonglong and OFulonglong preprocessor definitions that
  expand to the platform specific long long type or are undefined if
  no such type is available.
  Reimplemented fixed width integer types employing these long long
  types and refined integer traits to use the primitive types instead
  of the fixed with types in their specializations.

- Further enhanced by-reference relationships:
  Now storing the value type of a referenced node (target content item) in the
  by-reference tree node class in order to facilitate IOD constraint checking.
  Added new methods to by-reference tree node class in order to avoid direct
  access to the member variables (by a friend class), and to allow updating the
  referenced node. Added missing support for by-reference relationships in
  DSRDocumentSubTree::checkSubTreeConstraints(). Also added a new test on this.

- Clarified use of template identification:
  Made it clearer that the template identification using the Content Template
  Sequence (0040,A504) is only applicable to CONTAINER content items. At the
  time when the development of the "dcmsr" module started, this restriction was
  not present in the DICOM standard (see DICOM PS 3.3-2000 for details).

- Reimplemented various getXXX() methods:
  Reimplemented various public getXXX() methods in derived tree class, but in
  the "protected" section. This also avoids some explicit type casts.

- Changed return type of addContentItem(node*):
  Changed return type of addContentItem() method that expects a pointer to a
  newly created document tree node. It now returns an OFCondition (like other
  similar methods) instead of the pointer to the tree node that was passed to
  it. Also fixed possible memory leaks in case adding the new tree node failed.

- Cleaned up handling of "unknown" relationships:
  Made sure that the "unknown" relationship type is only permitted on top-level
  in a document subtree. This will be used for certain DICOM SR templates.

**** Changes from 2014.07.16 (riesmeier)

- Added cloneSubTree() method to tree classes:
  Added cloneSubTree() method to the tree classes. This allows for copying a
  particular subtree from an SR document tree or from another subtree. Also
  added new tests for these methods.

- Added gotoFirst() and gotoLast() methods:
  Added gotoFirst() and gotoLast() methods, which allow for setting the cursor
  to the first or last node on the same level (i.e. the first or last sibling).

**** Changes from 2014.07.07 (schlamelcher)

- Fixed a wrong type-alias for OFintegral_constant:
  The type-alias defined when C++11 support was enabled did not honor the
  special nature of std::integral_constant which takes a non-type argument
  as its second template parameter.
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/oftraits.h

- Introduced C++11-like alignment support:
  Created configure tests that detect the availability of various native
  alignment specifiers on different platform / compiler combinations.
  Implemented fallback definitions for OFalignas and OFalignof based on these
  specifiers and the non-standard macros "OFalign" and "OFalign_typename"
  which compensate for the reduced functionality available on Microsoft
  compilers by employing C++ templates.
  OFalign and OFalign_typename are also available on compilers supplying true
  alignment support, making them the most platform-independent
  implementations.
  Added:   ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/ofalign.h
  Affects: CMake/GenerateDCMTKConfigure.cmake
           CMake/osconfig.h.in
           config/aclocal.m4
           config/configure
           config/configure.in
           config/include/dcmtk/config/osconfig.h.in

- Fixed an alignment problem in OFoptional:
  OFoptional now uses a policy based approach to manage its storage,
  implemented as OFoptional_traits. This allows to customize memory
  allocation and state management, as well as the default construction
  policy.
  The default implementation now uses OFalign when available, to align the
  storage appropriately for its content type. If OFalign is not supported,
  OFoptional falls back to an implementation employing pointers and
  allocating the memory on the heap.
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/ofoption.h
           ofstd/tests/toption.cc

- Fixed building 32 bit targets with mingw-w64:
  Added configure-time tests for some file access functions that aren't
  available on every MinGW distribution.

**** Changes from 2014.07.02 (riesmeier)

- Removed year component from version field:
  Removed the name of the edition of the DICOM standard, i.e. "2014a" for the
  current edition, from the version field of each DICOM attribute. Since the
  DICOM standard will now be published/updated more often, the complete data
  dictionary will be generated automatically several times a year. Having the
  year component in the version field would change each entry every time and
  would make it hard (if not impossible) to see what has actually changed.

**** Changes from 2014.07.01 (riesmeier)

- Updated data dictionary for DICOM 2014a edition:
  Updated data dictionary for the latest edition of the DICOM standard, which
  has been released on 2014-06-30. Since the data dictionary was already
  up-to-date regarding the recently approved Supplements and CPs, there should
  be no changes apart from the name of the underlying DICOM standard edition.

- Fixed ofstd_tatof error on older MSVC versions:
  Older MSVC versions handle underflows incorrectly, therefore
  the respective test is skipped on these compilers.
  Affects: ofstd/tests/tatof.cc

- Fixed DCMTK-Exports for custom module setups:
  The variable 'DCMTK_MODULES' is now honored while generating exports,
  to skip modules the user removed from the build.
  Affects: CMake/DCMTKConfig.cmake.in

  Affects: CMake/osconfig.h.in
           ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/ofoption.h

- Added 'DCMTK_USE_CXX11_STL' and 'DCMTK_CXX11_FLAGS':
  These flags control DCMTK's behavior regarding C++11 features.
  DCMTK_USE_CXX11_STL may be used to switch between DCMTK's own classes and
  the respective native C++11 implementations. DCMTK will try to set the
  appropriate CXX_FLAGS to enable C++11 when DCMTK_USE_CXX11_STL is set.
  DCMTK_CXX11_FLAGS may be used to override which CXX_FLAGS DCMTK sets, for
  example to use C++14 instead of C++11.

- Minor fixes and workarounds for Microsoft's compilers:
  Microsoft Visual Studio again shows its lack of standard compliance,
  especially in the hard bug where calling "operator->()" does
  something different than calling "->".
  Affects: dcmimage/include/dcmtk/dcmimage/diqthash.h
           ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/ofoption.h

**** Changes from 2014.06.04 (riesmeier)

- Fixed issue with text alignment in PatternLayout:
  Fixed issue with text alignment in oflog's PatternLayout. After switching to
  log4cplus version 1.1.0 the format specifiers for left and right justified
  text of a particular width did not work any more. This has been fixed by
  returning to the implementation of the previous log4cplus version 1.0.x.
  Also removed trailing spaces and fixed some typos.
  Affects: oflog/libsrc/patlay.cc

- Fixed some Doxygen related issues (and a typo).
  Affects: dcmnet/include/dcmtk/dcmnet/scppool.h

**** Changes from 2014.06.02 (schlamelcher)

**** Changes from 2014.05.27 (schlamelcher)

- Modified DcmQuantColorHashTable to perform lazy initialization:
  To improve performance, DcmQuantColorHashTable now creates the internal
  items when they are accessed for the first time instead of at its
  initialization.
  Thanks to Takeo Satomi <takeo.satomi@gmail.com> for the suggested
  improvement.

- Fixed wrong ifdef syntax:
  Thanks to Andrey Fedorov <andrey.fedorov@gmail.com> for the suggested fix.
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/ofexport.h

**** Changes from 2014.05.06 (riesmeier)

- Added further error handling options:
  Added error handling options known from dsrdump and dsr2html to dsr2xml.
  Please be careful with these new command line options since they disable
  certain validation checks on the DICOM SR input file and, therefore, might
  result in non-standard conformant output.
  Affects: dcmsr/apps/dsr2xml.cc

- Updated data dictionary for DICOM 2013 edition:
  Updated data dictionary for the latest edition of the DICOM standard, which
  has been released on 2014-04-30. Major parts of the "dicom.dic" file have
  been generated automatically based on the machine-readable DocBook version of
  Part 6 and 7 of the DICOM standard. In addition, all recently approved final
  text Supplements and CPs have been added manually. Since the data dictionary
  was already quite up-to-date, there should be minor changes only.
  Affects: dcmdata/data/dicom.dic

           dcmdata/libsrc/dcdictzz.cc

**** Changes from 2014.05.01 (riesmeier)

- Added explicit type casts to avoid warnings:
  Added explicit type casts to avoid warnings reported by gcc 4.7.2 (Linux)
  with additional flags or MSVC++ with higher warning level (C4244). Thanks
  to Rasmus Christian Pedersen <zerhacken@yahoo.com> for the original report.
  Affects: dcmnet/apps/dcmrecv.cc
           dcmnet/apps/dcmsend.cc

  Fixed inconsistent parameter type for setMaxReceivePDULength() method.
  Affects: dcmnet/include/dcmtk/dcmnet/scu.h
           dcmnet/libsrc/scu.cc

**** Changes from 2014.04.29 (riesmeier)

- Access the (total) number of frames in an image:
  Added support for accessing the value of Number of Frames (0028,0008), i.e.
  the number of frames stored in a DICOM file/dataset.
  Affects: dcmimgle/include/dcmtk/dcmimgle/dcmimage.h

- Minor fixes (whitespace and line ending errors).
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/ofexbl.h
           ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/oftraits.h

**** Changes from 2014.04.25 (schlamelcher)

- Fixed possibly wrong overload resolution in DSRCodedEntryValue:
  The introduction of the "check" parameter, which was added to the
  constructor and the "setCode"-method of DSRCodedEntryValue
  (see changes from 2012.06.11) yielded the possibility of string
  literals being automatically converted to OFBool and therefore being
  misinterpreted as the value of "check" instead of "codeMeaning".
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrcodvl.h
           dcmsr/libsrc/dsrcodvl.cc

- Introduced the new explicit boolean type OFExplicitBool:
  OFExplicitBool can be used to restrict an overloaded function's
  parameter to "real" OFBool values, e.g. pointers and numeric values
  can NOT be converted to OFExplicitBool implicitly.
  Added:   ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/ofexbl.h

- Added support for some additional C++11 traits:
  Added aliases / fallback implementations for the C++11 <type-traits>
  std::conditional, std::is_same, std::is_array, std::is_function,
  std::remove_reference, std::remove_const, std::remove_volatile,
  std::remove_cv, std::remove_extent, std::add_pointer and std::decay.
  Note: Due to the lack of variadic-templates in pre C++11 compilers,
  the fallback implementation of OFis_function has reduced functionality,
  currently only detecting functions with up to three arguments!
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/oftraits.h

**** Changes from 2014.04.24 (riesmeier)

- Added support for determining the FrameTime:
  Added support for determining the value of Frame Time (0018,1063), i.e. the
  nominal time between individual frames, from the DICOM dataset (if present).
  Affects: dcmimage/apps/dcm2pnm.cc

           dcmdata/libsrc/dcuid.cc

**** Changes from 2014.04.16 (schlamelcher)

- Fixed most of the warnings in ofstd and oflog:
  Compiled with extensive warning options except -Wtraditional and corrected
  most of the problems.

**** Changes from 2014.04.14 (schlamelcher)

- Added documentation for the new macro "DOXYGEN":
  The macro DOXYGEN is defined when generating the documentation with doxygen
  and should NEVER be defined when compiling with a C/C++ compiler.
  See config/docs/macros.txt for details.
  Affects: config/docs/macros.txt

- Added support for some C++11 types, literals and traits:
  Updated implementation of fixed-width integer types to better conform the
  C++11 standard. This includes OFintptr_t and OFuintptr_t as integer types
  capable of holding a pointer-value.
  Implemented aliases for C++11's nullptr / nullptr_t (OFnullptr / OFnullptr_t)
  an the respective fallback implementations for older compilers.
  Introduced new header file "oftraits.h" as pendant to C++11's <type-traits>,
  currently implementing integral constants, enable_if and is_signed /
  is_unsigned. See http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/type_traits for
  details.
  Added:   ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/oftraits.h

**** Changes from 2014.04.14 (riesmeier)

- Optionally disable isFilenameValid() check:
  Added optional parameter to checkDicomFile() and loadAndCheckDicomFile()
  that allows one to disable the check for a valid DICOM filename (used as the
  value for ReferencedFileID within the DICOMDIR). This is because the file
  might be renamed after one of these methods is called.
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dcddirif.h
           dcmdata/libsrc/dcddirif.cc

- Simplified creation of temporary DICOMDIR file:
  Replaced creation of a temporary DICOMDIR file by a simpler approach: Just
  append ".tmp" to the DICOMDIR filename (in the specified output directory).
  This also makes sure that on Windows systems directory names with special
  characters (in UTF-16 encoding) are supported.
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dcdicdir.h
           dcmdata/libsrc/dcdicdir.cc

**** Changes from 2014.04.13 (riesmeier)

- Output to debug logger if memory allocation fails.
  Affects: dcmimgle/include/dcmtk/dcmimgle/diinpxt.h

- Fixed typo in comment.
  Affects: dcmimgle/include/dcmtk/dcmimgle/dimopx.h

- Use non-throwing new and delete operator:
  Use non-throwing new and delete operator for large memory buffers in order to
  avoid exceptions. Output to debug logger if memory allocation fails.
  Affects: dcmimage/include/dcmtk/dcmimage/dicopxt.h
           dcmimgle/include/dcmtk/dcmimgle/dimopxt.h

**** Changes from 2014.04.11 (riesmeier)

- Enhanced createDirectory() function:
  Added support for Windows-specific wide character encoding (UTF-16) to the
  createDirectory() helper function. The second parameter "rootDir" is still
  optional, but has no default value any more (due to the fact that OFFilename
  is not completely specified in the header file; forward declaration only).
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/ofstd.h
           ofstd/libsrc/ofstd.cc

- Enhanced removeRootDirFromPathname() function:
  Added support for Windows-specific wide character encoding (UTF-16) to the
  removeRootDirFromPathname() helper function. Also added a new test case.
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/ofstd.h
           ofstd/libsrc/ofstd.cc
           ofstd/tests/tests.cc
           ofstd/tests/tofstd.cc

- Fixed various typos in comments.
  Affects: dcmimgle/include/dcmtk/dcmimgle/dcmimage.h

**** Changes from 2014.04.09 (riesmeier)

- Fixed issue with untyped NULL reported by MSVC++.
  Affects: ofstd/tests/tofstd.cc

**** Changes from 2014.04.08 (riesmeier)

- Added test for OFStandard::appendFilenameExtension().
  Affects: ofstd/tests/tests.cc
           ofstd/tests/tofstd.cc

- Fixed some issues with wide character support:
  In combineDirAndFilename(), there was an issue with empty directory names
  being converted to "." if parameter "allowEmptyDirName" = OFFalse. And in
  appendFilenameExtension(), support for 8-bit character file extensions was
  missing, e.g. append ".bak" to a wide or 8-bit character string.
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/ofstd.h
           ofstd/libsrc/ofstd.cc

**** Changes from 2014.04.08 (schlamelcher)

- Minor fixes in dcmdata:
  Fixed warnings in dictionary generator instead of in the generated code.
  Re-enabled variadic macros for mingw. The option "-Wno-variadic-macros"
  should be used instead of disabling this feature.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcdictzz.cc
           dcmdata/libsrc/mkdictbi.cc
           oflog/include/dcmtk/oflog/logmacro.h

**** Changes from 2014.04.07 (riesmeier)

- Added support for recently approved CPs:
  Added support for CP-1282, CP-1285, CP-1325 and CP-1326 to the data
  dictionary.
  Affects: dcmdata/data/dicom.dic

           dcmwlm/include/dcmtk/dcmwlm/wltypdef.h

- Made sure that "Files" section is available:
  Made sure that "Files" section is available in Doxygen generated HTML output.
  Also disabled undocumented members in order to hide unwanted macros.
  Affects: doxygen/htmldocs.cfg

- Made sure that header file is parsed by Doxygen:
  Added Doxygen command that makes sure that the file is actually parsed for
  global functions, typedefs, enums, macros, etc. These are only the obvious
  header files, i.e. others are to be extended in the same way.

  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrdoc.h
           dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrdoctr.h

- Added readPatientData() and readStudyData():

  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrdoc.h
           dcmsr/libsrc/dsrdoc.cc

**** Changes from 2014.03.24 (schlamelcher)

  Compiled with extensive warning options except -Wtraditional and corrected
  most of the problems. Most of the remaining warnings in dcmdata are caused by
  files included from ofstd and will be resolved in a different commit.

**** Changes from 2014.03.21 (schlamelcher)

- Marked SCPPool-Test (dcmnet_scp_pool) as exhaustive:
  The current pool-testcase takes about 6 seconds, which is rather long
  compared to the other tests. It was therefore flagged as exhaustive test
  and is not run unless explicitly enabled.
  Affects: dcmnet/tests/tpool.c

- Fixed potential bug in dcmjpeg 12 and 16 bit variants:
  Applied a fix that was already present in the 8 bit variant to the other
  variants of the jpeg library.

           dcmjpeg/libijg16/jdhuff.c

- Fixed most of the warnings in dcmjpeg:
  Compiled with extensive warning options except -Wtraditional and corrected
  most of the problems. Tested with mingw-w64-4.8.1, gcc-4.7.2 (static and shared),
  Visual Studio 2013 Express, Visual Studio 2012 64 bit and clang-w64-3.5.0.
  Tested compression / decompression with various different settings for different
  compilers on appropriate DICOM images ("cabinet" and "car97_cd").
  Most of the remaining warnings in dcmjpeg are caused by files included from
  dcmimage and will be resolved in a different commit.

**** Changes from 2014.03.20 (riesmeier)

- Fixed small typos in comments.
  Affects: dcmimgle/include/dcmtk/dcmimgle/diinpxt.h

**** Changes from 2014.03.19 (riesmeier)

- Removed superfluous quotations marks:
  Removed superfluous quotations marks from CMake command ADD_DEFINITIONS()
  since they cause problems with Xcode 5.1 on Mac OS X.
  Thanks to forum user "oblivion81" for the report and suggested fix.
  Affects: CMake/dcmtkPrepare.cmake

**** Changes from 2014.03.17 (riesmeier)

- Fixed issue with automatically generated classes:
  Fixed issue with the detection of attributes nested in a sequence class (in
  the automatically generated source code). Sometimes, there were additional

- Pass OFString to DIMSE_createFilestream():
  Pass an OFString filename to DIMSE_createFilestream() instead of char* since
  this function now accepts an OFFilename instance.
  Affects: dcmnet/libsrc/scp.cc
           dcmnet/libsrc/scu.cc

- Fixed various typo.
  Affects: dcmnet/libsrc/dimse.cc

- DIMSE_createFilestream() now uses an OFFilename:
  The low-level network function DIMSE_createFilestream() now uses an OFFilename
  parameter instead of a char*. This allows for passing a wide character string
  to this function on Windows. The API remains stable since the OFFilename
  constructor also accepts a char*.
  Thanks to Peter Klotz <Peter.Klotz@ith-icoserve.com> for the suggestion.
  Affects: dcmnet/include/dcmtk/dcmnet/dimse.h

- Added check for Shared Functional Groups Sequence:
  Certain key attributes like Pixel Spacing (0028,0030) can also be nested
  within a functional group sequence of the Shared Functional Groups Sequence
  (5200,9229). Therefore, these attributes also have to be checked on this level
  and not only in the main dataset.

- Added missing data elements to BD profiles:
  Added missing data elements from PS3.11 Table H.3-2 to the various Blu-ray
  Disc (BD) media storage application profiles. Basically, the requirements for
  PATIENT, IMAGE and SPECTROSCOPY directory records are identical to those for
  the DVD profiles. Only the reference in Section M.3.3.1 was missed.

- Ensure CMake v2.6 still writes DCMTKConfig.cmake:
  The enhanced DCMTKConfig.cmake that was recently introduced relies on CMake
  version 2.8.8 or higher and uses the new CONFIGURE_PACKAGE_CONFIG_FILE
  command. This commit makes sure that older versions as the minimum CMake
  version 2.6 required by DCMTK produce a DCMTKConfig.cmake that has at
  least all the information it contained before the switch to
  CONFIGURE_PACKAGE_CONFIG_FILE.
  Added:   CMake/CMake/DCMTKConfig.cmake26.in

- Added another addContentItem() method:
  Added new addContentItem() method that expects a pointer to a newly created
  document tree node. This provides another approach of creating the document
  tree of an SR document, and avoids making the detour using getCurrentItem().

- Made installation of tag file optional:
  Made installation of Doxygen tag file optional in order to avoid an error
  message if it has not been generated, e.g. because "make html" was not called
  before "make install".
  Affects: doxygen/CMakeLists.txt

**** Changes from 2014.03.05 (onken)

- Enhanced DCMTK CMake exports for external projects:
  The files DCMTKConfig.cmake, DCMTKConfigVersion.cmake and
  DCMTKTargets.cmake are exported by CMake to the DCMTK build tree as
  as well as to the DCMTK installation directory. The files can be found
  and evaluated by other CMake-based projects using CMake's find_package
  command (in "Config" mode). The files describe DCMTK executables and
  libraries as well as DCMTK version information, which then can be
  facilitated in an automatic way by external projects to configure and
  perform their own build process. Thanks to Jean-Christophe Fillion-Robin
  <jchris.fillionr@kitware.com> for the original patch.

- Fixed wrong tag in CodingSchemeIdentificationSequence:
  Fixed wrong tag being used in CodingSchemeIdentificationSequence (0008,0110).
  Instead of Responsible Organization (0010,2299) it should be Coding Scheme
  Responsible Organization (0008,0116). This inconsistency was introduced back
  in the year 2003 with CP-324. This commit also changes the name of the

**** Changes from 2014.02.27 (schlamelcher)

- Fixed dll build on windows:
  Created a workaround for Visual Studio that disables dll storage specifiers
  when linking directly into the executable. This is needed since the
  built-in dictionary code is created by the tools mkdeftag and mkdictbi and
  thus those tools statically link the few required dcmdata source files
  instead of linking to dcmdata as a whole.

**** Changes from 2014.02.25 (riesmeier)

- Allow empty file-set ID in DICOMDIR (type 2):
  Allow file-set ID to be empty in a DICOMDIR since it is type 2. Also fixed
  spelling ("file-set ID" instead of "file set ID" or "fileset ID") where
  relevant, i.e. in log output and syntax usage.

- Use printError() instead of OFLOG_FATAL():
  Use OFConsoleApplication::printError() instead of OFLOG_FATAL() in case of a
  missing command line parameter.
  Affects: dcmdata/apps/dcmgpdir.cc

- Always use OFFilename() instead of "" as a default:
  Always use OFFilename instead of "" (empty 8-bit character string) as a
  default value in order to make sure that wide character support under Windows
  really works. This is because "" only initializes the char* member variable
  of OFFilename and not the wchar_t*.
  Affects: dcmdata/apps/dcmgpdir.cc

  strings in getDirNameFromPath() and normalizeDirName().
  Affects: ofstd/libsrc/ofstd.cc

**** Changes from 2014.02.22 (onken)

- Add libjpeg dependency for libtiff and minor changes:
  It is possible to build libtiff with libjpeg-based JPEG coding support.
  Thus CMake is told on Unix to add libjpeg includes and libraries so that
  tiff-based tools will be linked to libjpeg, too. This mirrors the
  ./configure behaviour under Unix. It is not tested whether libtiff
  actually was compiled with JPEG enabled. Additionally, the "QUIET" option
  was added to avoid CMake's FindModule scripts printing messages about
  external libraries that are already covered by explicit DCMTK messages.
  Re-ordered code for some external libraries. Thanks to Jean-Christophe
  Fillion-Robin <jchris.fillionr@kitware.com> for the original patch.
  Affects: CMake/3rdparty.cmake

**** Changes from 2014.02.21 (riesmeier)

  compiled with WIDE_CHAR_FILE_IO_FUNCTIONS or WIDE_CHAR_MAIN_FUNCTION defined.
  This issue was introduced with commit d084ebf, i.e. the previous one.

- Avoid passing NULL to OFString, which is deprecated:
  Avoid passing NULL to OFString in certain cases within normalizeDirName()
  since this is deprecated (and results in an annoying message in DEBUG mode).
  Affects: ofstd/libsrc/ofstd.cc

- Avoid passing invalid values to rename():
  In case wide character support is enabled, there was a chance that a NULL
  pointer could be passed to one of the two parameters of the rename() function.
  Affects: ofstd/libsrc/ofstd.cc

- Added new command line option --create-backup:
  Added new command line option --create-backup to explicitly show what the

- Make sure to handle setuid() return code properly:
  In some tools the return value of setuid() is not checked. In the worst
  case this could lead to privilege escalation since the process does not
  give up its root privileges and continue as root. Thanks to Hector Marco

- Added wide character support to this tool:
  Added support for the Windows-specific wide character encoding (UTF-16) to
  this command line tool, i.e. support for filenames with such an encoding.
  For this purpose, the toolkit has to be compiled with WIDE_CHAR_MAIN_FUNCTION
  and WIDE_CHAR_FILE_IO_FUNCTIONS being defined.

- Added OFFilename versions to some helper functions:
  Added OFFilename versions to the helper functions getDirNameFromPath(),
  getFilenameFromPath(), normalizeDirName(), combineDirAndFilename(),
  searchDirectoryRecursively() and getFileSize() in order to enhance the
  support for the Windows-specific wide character encoding (UTF-16).
  Internally, the same code is used for both the OFString and OFFilename
  version of the helper functions, which should facilitate finding any bugs.
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/ofstd.h

- Fixed issue with wrong check on stream compression:
  This wrong check had the result that the three uncompressed transfer syntaxes
  were proposed in "decompression mode" even if the pixel data could not be
  decompressed, e.g. in case of JPEG compression without a JPEG decoder.
  Affects: dcmnet/libsrc/dstorscu.cc

**** Changes from 2014.02.05 (riesmeier)

- Moved ACR/NEMA data dictionary to a separate file:
  Moved retired ACR/NEMA attributes to a separate dictionary file since they
  are officially part of the DICOM standard for many years now (see CP-607).
  Please note that this commit changes the prefix of some tag constants from
  "DCM_ACR_NEMA_" to "DCM_RETIRED_". Also a few tag constants disappeared
  (mainly ACR/NEMA group length attributes, which are retired in the DICOM
  standard anyway). However, since the old, manually compiled definitions are
  still available in a separate file, the old behavior can be restored by
  loading "acrnema.dic".

**** Changes from 2013.11.29 (riesmeier)

- Completed support for <InlineBinary> XML element:
  Completed support for the <InlineBinary> XML element used by the Native DICOM
  Model format. Now, also data elements with a VR of OD and OF can be encoded
  as base64. Closes DCMTK Feature #549.

**** Changes from 2013.11.28 (riesmeier)

- Do not check valueLoaded() for Native DICOM Model:
  Do not check whether a value has actually been loaded when writing an element
  value to XML output in the Native DICOM Model. This is because this concept
  is only known to the DCMTK-specific output format.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcelem.cc

- Fixed output of AT values in Native DICOM Model:
  Fixed wrong output format for Attribute Tag (AT) values in the Native DICOM
  Model. Supplement 166 (QIDO-RS) clarifies that the format is "GGGGEEEE", and
  not "(gggg,eeee)" as it was before (which is DCMTK's default string output
  format for AT values). Closes DCMTK Bug #551.

**** Changes from 2013.11.26 (riesmeier)

- Fixed issue with test "ofstd_markup_6" (Win32):
  Fixed issue with test "ofstd_markup_6" not running successfully on Windows
  systems (due to an incorrect length of the input string value).
  Thanks to forum user "ghleclerc" for the report.
  Affects: ofstd/tests/tmarkup.cc

- Fixed minor Doxygen-related issue in documentation:
  Doxygen requires three slashes "///" for documenting entities, e.g. members
  of an enumeration type. One slash was missing for CS_UTF8 in E_CharacterSet.
  Also fixed various typos in comments.
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrtypes.h

**** Changes from 2013.11.25 (riesmeier)

- Fixed name of PN component in Native DICOM Model:
  Fixed name of first PersonName (PN) component in Native DICOM Model.
  According to Supplement 166 (QIDO-RS) the XML element name is "Alphabetic"
  (and not "SingleByte" as it was before).
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcvrpn.cc

**** Changes from 2013.11.21 (riesmeier)

- Fixed minor Doxygen-related issue in documentation:
  Doxygen, the tool that is used for generating the HTML documentation from
  source code, requires that a "." is escaped under certain conditions, e.g.
  if this character does not define the end of a sentence as used for short
  class descriptions.
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/offile.h

**** Changes from 2013.11.19 (riesmeier)

- Added new option for disabling the VR checker:
  Added new command line option that allows for disabling the VR checker by
  setting the recently introduced global "dcmdata" flag accordingly.

- Added global flag for disabling the VR checker:
  Added global flag that allows for disabling the VR checker used by the
  various checkStringValue() methods. Since this checker is currently limited
  to ASCII and Latin-1, and the detection of the character set might fail for
  incorrectly encoded DICOM datasets, this check can be disabled globally.

- Removed redundant and outdated Word document:
  Removed redundant and outdated Word document "wwwapp.doc", which used to
  contain the same information as "wwwapp.txt". Closes DCMTK Feature #556.
  Removed: dcmwlm/docs/wwwapp.doc

- Added missing break statements to switch cases:
  Added missing break statements to switch cases, which previously resulted in
  a wrong return value of the CheckMatchingKey() method. Thanks to Peter Klotz
  <Peter.Klotz@ith-icoserve.com> for the bug report and patch.
  Affects: dcmwlm/libsrc/wlds.cc

**** Changes from 2013.11.17 (schlachter)

- Don't set the defines for thread local storage support incorrectly:
  If DCMTK_LOG4CPLUS_HAVE_TLS_SUPPORT is defined, the code uses it to mark
  variables as thread-local and expects the compiler to implement this.
  Otherwise, calls into the thread library are used. So defining it to an
  empty value makes oflog thread-unsafe. Thanks to Peter Klotz
  <Peter.Klotz@ith-icoserve.com> for the report and a test case.
  Affects: oflog/include/dcmtk/oflog/config/defines.h

**** Changes from 2013.11.15 (riesmeier)

- Avoid CMake warning on non-installable files.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/CMakeLists.txt

- Fixed build issue with shared libraries (Win32):
  Fixed link errors on Windows systems when building with BUILD_SHARED_LIB set
  to "ON". This caused the executables "mkdictbi" and "mkdeftag" to fail.
  Thanks to forum user "lars_matthaeus" for the original report.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/CMakeLists.txt

- Removed trailing white spaces from man pages files.
  Affects: doxygen/manpages/man1/*

**** Changes from 2013.11.14 (thiel)

- Updated man pages for new development snapshot.
  Affects: doxygen/manpages/man1/*

**** Changes from 2013.11.13 (onken)

- Avoid second OpenSSL initialization in constructor:
  OpenSSL's one-time initialization is performed in the TLS layer
  constructor. In multi-threaded environments this leads to multiple
  initialization calls if  more than one association is used at the
  same time. Thus a parameter was added in order to disable the
  initialization code if desired. Thanks to Peter Klotz
  <Peter.Klotz@ith-icoserve.com> for the report and suggested patch.
  Affects: dcmtls/include/dcmtk/dcmtls/tlslayer.h
           dcmtls/libsrc/tlslayer.cc

**** Changes from 2013.11.13 (riesmeier)

- Fixed issue with color icon images:
  According to the DICOM standard, color icon images should always be written
  with a value of "PALETTE COLOR" for Photometric Interpretation. Before this
  fix, also other color models like "RGB" were created for the optional icon
  image of an IMAGE content item. Closes DCMTK Bug #577.
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrimgvl.h
           dcmsr/libsrc/Makefile.dep
           dcmsr/libsrc/dsrimgvl.cc

- Added comment on wrong color model for icon images:
  Added comment on relevant API methods that for color images, the photometric
  interpretation "RGB" is used, which is not allowed according to the DICOM
  standard (see PS 3.3 Section F.7). This will be fixed in the future by using
  "PALETTE COLOR" instead. Noted as DCMTK Bug #577.
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrimgvl.h

  Fixed doubled tag output in XML output of VR OF. Thanks to Peter Klotz
  <Peter.Klotz@ith-icoserve.com> for the report and suggested patch.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcvrof.cc

**** Changes from 2013.11.11 (onken)

- Make sure CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE has a default value:
  CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES is set for generators that support multiple
  configuration types (and have per-configuration subdirectories like
  Debug and Release). It is empty for other generators and for those
  generators the build type is controlled at CMake time by
  CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE. Patch ensures that CMAKE-BUILD-TYPE has "Release" as
  a default value. Thanks to Kent Williams <norman-k-williams@uiowa.edu>
  and Jean-Christophe Fillion-Robin <jchris.fillionr@kitware.com> for
  the patch.
  Affects: CMake/dcmtkPrepare.cmake

- Described movescu storage SCP timeout problem:
  In case movescu acts as a storage SCP, it hangs forever if storage client
  never closes the underlying association.
  Affects: dcmnet/docs/movescu.man

- Fixed comments.
  Affects: dcmwlm/libsrc/wlfsim.cc

**** Changes from 2013.11.07 (riesmeier)

- Fixed bug that could cause a crash:
  Fixed bug that could cause a crash when processing an image with an empty
  value for Image Type. This could cause a NULL pointer to be dereferenced.
  Thanks to Tiago D'Agostini <tiago.dagostini@pixeon.com> for the report.
  Affects: dcmimage/apps/dcmscale.cc

**** Changes from 2013.11.04 (riesmeier)

- Added Corneal Topography Map Storage SOP Class:
  Added Corneal Topography Map Storage SOP Class (introduced only recently with
  Supplement 168) to the list of accepted SOP classes, since there still was
  one entry left.
  Affects: dcmnet/etc/storescp.cfg

**** Changes from 2013.10.31 (onken)

- Corrected misleading transfer syntax error message:
  When sending C-ECHO failed because no valid transfer syntax for the
  Verification SOP Class could be found, then a misleading error message
  was triggered complaining about missing Verification SOP Class support
  for Little Endian Implicit. Now the message does only tell that no
  valid presentation context for C-ECHO could be found.
  Thanks to Mathieu Malaterre <mathieu.malaterre@gmail.com> for the
  original report.
  Affects: dcmnet/libsrc/scu.cc

  standard text, Table C.18.4-1 in PS 3.3-2011).
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrimgvl.h

  Added comments that the conditional/optional attributes Referenced Segment
  Number (0062,000B) and Referenced Real World Value Mapping Instance Sequence
  (0008,114B) are not yet supported by this class. Such still-missing features

- Use helper method for deleting data elements:
  Use the helper method DcmItem::findAndDeleteElement() for deleting certain
  data elements in all items of a particular sequence.
  Affects: dcmsr/libsrc/dsrtypes.cc

- Iterate more efficiently over sequence items:
  Changed the way sequence items are iterated. Now, the nextInContainer()
  method of the DcmSequenceOfItems class is used instead of getItem(). This
  approach is much more efficient when a sequence contains a huge number of
  items, because of the current implementation of the getItem() method.

  use extended characters that are not yet supported by dcmdata's VR checker
  (i.e. all but ASCII and ISO Latin-1). Partially closes DCMTK Bug #547.
  Affects: dcmsr/libsrc/dsrcodvl.cc

- Avoid unnecessary copies of sequence elements:
  By referencing the sequence elements instead of copying, it is also possible
  to access the SpecificCharacterSet element of the surrounding dataset/item,
  which is needed for the VR checker. Partially closes DCMTK Bug #547.

           dcmsr/libsrc/dsrsoprf.cc

- Added new variant of checkElementValue():
  This new variant gets a pointer to a DICOM element (and not a reference).
  In addition, the getAndCheckXXXFromDataset() methods now make sure that no
  element copy is created _before_ the element is checked. This is because
  otherwise there would be no access to the SpecificCharacterSet element of
  the surrounding dataset/item, which is needed for the VR checker.
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrtypes.h
           dcmsr/libsrc/dsrtypes.cc

- Added 'charset' parameter to checkStringValue():
  Added optional character set parameter to static function checkStringValue()
  in order to make sure that only ASCII and Latin-1 strings are checked for
  their conformance with the VR definition (this is a current limitation of the
  underlying VR checker). Also the checkValue() method now uses the value of
  the SpecificCharacterSet element of the surrounding dataset/item.

  "bit preserving mode".
  Affects: dcmnet/include/dcmtk/dcmnet/dstorscp.h
           dcmnet/libsrc/dstorscp.cc

- Receive C-STORE request dataset directly to file:

**** Changes from 2013.08.27 (riesmeier)

- Restructured implementation of handleSTORERequest():
  Completely restructured the implementation of handleSTORERequest(), which now
  consists of calling 3 separate methods successively: receiveSTORERequest(),
  checkSTORERequest() and sendSTOREResponse(). This could be the prototype for
  all other network messages currently supported by this class. Also regrouped
  the various network message methods.

  Removed explicit class name when calling a derived method (as long as the
  method name is unambiguous, i.e. the compiler does not complain).
  Affects: dcmnet/libsrc/dstorscp.cc

- Do not copy received dataset in memory:
  Made sure that the DICOM dataset received via a C-STORE request is not copied
  in memory (i.e. to a DcmFileFormat structure) in order to store it as a DICOM
  file (i.e. with file meta information header).
  Affects: dcmnet/include/dcmtk/dcmnet/dstorscp.h

  filename for an empty string and return an error code in such a case.
  Affects: dcmnet/libsrc/scpcfg.cc

**** Changes from 2013.08.08 (riesmeier)

- Reimplemented sendSTOREResponse() method:
  Please note that the signature of sendSTOREResponse() changed with this
  commit. There are now two variants of this method: one that is quite easy to
  use and the other that allows for specifying more details.
  Affects: dcmnet/include/dcmtk/dcmnet/scp.h
