Q: Using dcm2pnm to convert a DICOM image I get the following error message:
   "invalid value for 'PhotometricInterpretation' (LittleEndianExplicit)".

A: [This only applies to systems where the data dictionary is not built-in
   but loaded from file (typical for Unix systems).]  Most likely the
   environment variable DCMDICTPATH is not set-up properly.  Please note
   that it needs to point to the data dictionary file, not to a directory
   (see also older entries below).

Q: Using the "DicomImage" class to handle DICOM images I get the following
   error message when accesing the pixel data: "ERROR: cannot change to
   unencapsulated representation for pixel data".

A: It seems that the image is compressed.  If it uses a JPEG compression
   scheme you need to register the JPEG decompressor code:
   - add '#include "djdecode.h"' to your source file
   - call 'DJDecoderRegistration::registerCodecs();' at program init
   - call 'DJDecoderRegistration::cleanup();' before program exit
   That should be all you need to do.  See doc++ documentation for details.

Q: The transmission of DICOM objects to the storescp or imagectn application
   works but is incredibly slow - about one 512k image per 15-20 seconds.

A: The problem is most likely related to reverse DNS lookup.  When accepting
   an association, DCMTK attempts to find out the remote system's hostname.
   This can take some time if the remote system is not known to the local
   DNS, in particular in Windows systems.  Try to start the application with
   the additional command line option "--disable-host-lookup" (short: -dhl)
   which was introduced with DCMTK 3.5.0.  The problem should disappear then.

Q: Is DCMTK safe for use in multi-threaded applications?

A: No, in general DCMTK is not thread-safe.
   Starting with release 3.4.2, experimental multi-thread support has been
   added to the ofstd, dcmdata and dcmimgle libraries within DCMTK, i.e.
   everything that handles DICOM data in memory and in files is thread-safe
   as long as each object instance is only handled by one thread at a time.
   Only a few globals (in particular the DICOM data dictionary) are safe for
   use by  multiple threads in parallel, based on read-write locks. Multi-
   thread support requires that either the Posix, Solaris or Win32 thread
   API is available.
   Other DCMTK libraries are still unsafe for use in multi-threaded
   applications, in particular the dcmnet library that implements the
   DICOM network protocol is not reentrant.

Q: I have successfully installed DCMTK on a Unix system, however, all
   DICOM network communication fails with strange error messages, for example:
   Echo [1], echoscu: Failed:
      800a2 DIMSE: Command Build Failed: dimcmd:addUS: Cannot add Uint16:
   Element: (0000,0100) Unknown Tag & Data

A: When the DCMTK network tools complain about unknown (0000,xxxx) tags, the
   reason is most likely a problem with the DCMDICTPATH environment
   variable, which probably points to an existing structure in the file
   system (e.g. to a directory) but not to the DICOM data dictionary file
   itself.
   DCMDICTPATH needs to point to the data dictionary file, not to a
   directory, e.g. use "setenv DCMDICTPATH /my_dicom_directory/lib/dicom.dic"
   See the documentation file dcmtk/dcmdata/doc/datadict.txt for more
   details about using DICOM data dictionaries.

Q: I am using GNU gcc (or egcs) to compile DCMTK, and receive many warnings
   of the following type:
       libXXX.a(XXX.o): warning: multiple common of `XXX type_info node'
       XXX.o: warning: previous common is here
   Is this a bug in DCMTK? Can I avoid this warning somehow?

A: This is not a bug in DCMTK but a problem with GNU's implementation of RTTI.
   It affects at least egcs and gcc 2.9x when used with GNU ld,
   a combination that typically found in recent Linux distributions.
   The warning is harmless and can be ignored.

   If you are really annoyed by this warning, there are two ways to avoid it:
   1. You can compile DCMTK with RTTI support switched off. DCMTK does not use
      RTTI, so this is safe and will also result in smaller binaries.
      However, the resulting libraries cannot be linked with other C++
      libraries that were compiled with RTTI support switched on.
      To disable RTTI, add the flag '-fno-rtti' to the CXXFLAGS setting
      in 'config/Makefile.def' after configuration, but before compiling.
   2. You can globally switch the warning off by changing gcc's configuration.
      This is located in <install_prefix>/lib/gcc-lib/<platform>/<release>/specs,
      e.g. /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/i486-linux/2.95/specs.
      This is a text file. You just need to remove the flag '-warn-common'
      in the section beginning with '*lib:'. Make sure you know what you're doing!

Q: I want to use DCMTK on Unixware. Is there anything I should know about?

A: Yes, we received many useful remarks about compiling DCMTK on Unixware from
   Wolfgang Rapp <w1.rapp@von.ulm.de>.

   1. If you want your Unixware binaries to run on all Unixware 2.x systems,
      you should compile on Unixware 2.0.x. Compiling on 2.1.x will result in
      binaries that are not backwards compatible with 2.0.x.
   2. The following lines will configure DCMTK for Unixware and the standard CC
      (the examples are for csh, change appropriately for use with sh):
        setenv LD_RUN_PATH /opt/lib
        setenv CFLAGS   -I/usr/include -I/opt/include -I/usr/X/include -I/usr/ucbinclude
        setenv CPPFLAGS -I/usr/include -I/opt/include -I/usr/X/include -I/usr/ucbinclude
        setenv LIBS -L/opt/lib -lsocket -lnsl -L/usr/ucblib -lucb
        ./configure
   3. Configure may be unable to find the system functions memcmp, memcpy and memset.
      You should make sure that the file config/include/config.h, which is created
      during the configure process, contains:
        #define HAVE_MEMCMP 1
        #define HAVE_MEMCPY 1
        #define HAVE_MEMSET 1
   4. The Makefiles generated by configure require GNU Make. This is available for Unixware
      in pkgadd format at ftp://ftp.freebird.org/

   And here some comments for more advanced users:
   -  DCMTK on Unixware requires some BSD functions from /usr/ucblib/libucb.a
      and some include files from /usr/ucbinclude. At least on Unixware 2.0.3
      you should be careful because readdir() in libucb.a is known to be defective
      and there are conflicts between the /usr/include and /usr/ucbinclude versions
      of stdio.h, unistd.h and strings.h
   -  All versions of libtool for Unixware (at least up to version 1.2) are unable
      to generate shared libraries. A patch for libtool is available on request
      from Wolfgang Rapp <w1.rapp@von.ulm.de>.

Q: When I run the "imagectn" application on my UNIX system, it seems to put
   image files in /tmp instead of the directory specified as the storage area
   in my "configrc" file, although the "index.dat" file does get put there. Is
   there anything I might be doing wrong ?

A: Imagectn uses the tempnam(3S) system call to create the filename
   for an image file to be stored in the database. tempnam() will use
   /tmp as target directory if
   - the target directory (from configrc) does not exist
   - imagectn has no write access rights to the target directory
   - you have an environment variable TMPDIR pointing to /tmp
   - you are running imagectn as root

   We generally recommend not to run imagectn as root. If you want imagectn
   to listen on port 104, change the owner of the imagectn binary to "root"
   and the access rights to 4755 (s-bit mode). This will allow imagectn to
   open the socket with super-user rights and then switch to the "safe"
   user ID of the calling user.

Q: How can I create the DCMTK libraries as shared objects (.so-files)
   which are dynamically loaded when the DCMTK applications are started?

A: This depends on your C++ compiler and operating system.
   When building shared objects containing C++ code,
   special handling for templates and ctors/dtors
   of global variables is required. Therefore, on most systems the
   shared object must be created with the C++ compiler, not with "ld".

   If you are using gcc on a platform where the "-shared" flag is supported,
   the following steps will create a 'dynamic' DCMTK:
   1. run rootconf and configure (see the INSTALL file).
   2. edit the file 'config/Makefile.def' to include the following settings:
      CFLAGS= -fPIC -O2
      CXXFLAGS= -fPIC -O2
      AR= gcc
      ARFLAGS= -shared -o
      LIBEXT= so
   3. build and install the toolkit with "make", "make install"
      and "make install-lib".
   4. make sure that the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH
      contains the directory where the DCMTK shared objects are installed.

Q: I am trying to compile DCMTK on a HP-UX 10 machine with the HP C++ compiler.
   Compilation fails with the error message
   "CC: sorry, not implemented: cannot expand value-returning inline ...
   with call of non-value-returning inline ..."

A: You should use the compiler options "+d +a1" to prevent the
   HP compiler from attempting to inline code.
   Before using "configure", you might type:
     setenv CXX "CC +d +a1"

   Reported by Shashikala Duraiswami <shash@alexis.com>.

Q: I am trying to compile DCMTK on a SGI IRIX 6.x machine with gcc 2.7.2.
   The configure script terminates with the following error messsage:

     checking whether the C compiler (gcc  ) works... no
     configure: error: installation or configuration problem:
     C compiler cannot create executables.

   The dcmtk/config/config.log file contains:

     configure:747: gcc -o conftest    conftest.c  1>&5
     collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
     ld: Segmentation fault.  Removing output file...

A: You use a gcc compiled on a SGI IRIX 5.x machine.
   On IRIX 6.x the -old_ld must be specified on all compiler
   calls which involve linking. The flag must be specified before
   any -o option. We have created a shell script which
   patches "configure" to allow the -old_ld option to work.
   In the dcmtk directory, type:
     config/mvldflags config/configure
     setenv LDFLAGS -old_ld
   After that, configure will create appropriate Makefiles.

Q: I am compiling DCMTK on a SGI IRIX 6.x machine, and I receive
   many warnings of the type

     /usr/bin/ld:
     The shared object /usr/lib/libsocket.so did not resolve any symbols.
     You may want to remove it from your link line.

A: On some IRIX machines, the BSD socket functions are contained both
   in the libnsl/libsocket libraries and in libc. You can ignore the warnings
   (they will do no harm) or remove "-lsocket -lnsl" from the "LIBS=..." line
   in config/Makefile.def after the configure process.

Q: I am trying to compile DCMTK on Solaris with Sun Workshop 4.x.
   The code compiles without problems, but when trying to link
   applications, the linker reports unresolved externals
   in the DCMTK libraries and fails.

A: The Sun Workshop 4.x compilers use a new method of handling
   C++ template classes which requires that all libraries (lib*.a)
   containing templates must be created by the C++ compiler
   and not by "ar". Therefore, *before* executing the configure
   script for dcmtk, you should set environment variables as follows:
     setenv CC cc
     setenv CXX CC
     setenv AR CC
     setenv ARFLAGS "-xar -o"
   Configure will then create the appropriate code in the Makefiles.

1997.09.16

Q: The INSTALL file says that DCMTK can be compiled using the Cygnus
   GNU-Win32 development environment for Windows95/NT.  However, Step 2
   of the install instructions does not work because the configure script
   fails completely (it reports "permission denied" problems and generates
   strange files in all the sub-directories).

A: You need to make sure that your PATH environment variable is set up
   so that the GNU-Win32 tools directory will be searched before the
   standard windows locations (e.g. \WINNT\..) when when executing a
   program.  The main problem is that the DCMTK configure scripts use
   the Unix-like "find" program whereas Windows has its own, incompatible,
   "find" program.  Unless you arrange otherwise, the wrong "find" program
   will be used.

Q: All of the programs print the message
   "Warning: no data dictionary loaded, check environment variable:
   DCMDICTPATH" then seem to produce strange results.

A: The DICOM data dictionary could not be loaded.  It has probably
   not been properly installed.  The default location for this file
   (under Unix) is /usr/local/dicom/lib/dicom.dic but an
   alternive location can be specified by using the DCMDICTPATH
   environment variable.
   See the documentation file dcmtk/dcmdata/doc/datadict.txt for more
   details about using DICOM data dictionaries.

----
1997.09.12

Q: All of the programs load a data dictionary from the text file
   /usr/local/dicom/lib/dicom.dic before they can do anything.  The
   overhead for this flexibility is very high.  I want my programs
   to start much faster.

A: You can use a built-in in data dictionary instead.
   The code for this already exists (dcmtk/dcmdata/libsrc/dcdictzz.cc)
   and can be regenerated at any time by (see the dcmdata library Makefile:
   dcmtk/dcmdata/libsrc/Makefile.in).  You can even have the best of both
   worlds and have the main data dictionary built-in with additions loaded
   from text files (via the DCMDICTPATH environment variable).

   See the documentation file dcmtk/dcmdata/doc/datadict.txt for more
   details about using DICOM data dictionaries.

   The example Visual C++ project makefiles for the Windows95/NT
   platform already use the built-in data dictionary code.

Q: Does DCMTK compile on Microsoft Windows 95/98/2000/NT ?

A: Yes.  We have added support for Win32 environments.  Look at the INSTALL
   file for instructions on how to compile under Windows 95/98/2000/NT.

   Please note, there are no Windows applications with graphical user interface
   in DCMTK.  The apps programs only run in a Windows command shell.

Q: I'm using a Nextstep system.  I run the configure script but it claims
   that my compiler is a cross-compiler (produces the message: 'checking
   whether cross-compiling... yes') and produces nonsense results.

A: Your compiler seems to be producing code which cannot always be executed.
   There seems to be a problem with the C++ name demangler causing the
   linker to occasionally generate bad code.  This problem occurs most
   frequently when the using NFS file-systems.  A workaround (at least for
   Nextstep 3.3 Developer) is to modify the shell script /bin/ld++ and remove
   the pipe to the c++filt program.  /bin/ld++ then just contains a call to
   the linker (i.e. ld $*).

----
1997.05.22

Q: I'm using a unix system.  I run the configure script and then make but
   the build stops because the file 'config/Makefile.def' could not be found.

A: This means that the configure script has failed to create the
   necessary makefile definitions.  There could be several reasons for this.
   Look at the output of the configure program.  If you see a line like:

	checking whether cross-compiling... yes

   then your compiler seems to be producing code which cannot be executed.
   You could be using a very old compiler or some (shared) libraries could
   not be located.  It has been reported that some GNU C++ installations
   install shared libraries in non-standard places (e.g. /opt/gnu/lib)
   and that environment variables must be set before the compiler can be
   used (e.g. the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable).

1996.09.24

Q: Where is rest of the documentation?

A: All of the available DCMTK documentation is distributed in
   the DCMTK package.  There is documentation about how to configure
   and run the programs.  What is missing is documentation about
   how to use the libraries.  Currently, the only way to learn how
   to use the libraries is to look at the example programs and
   do things the same way.  Hopefully, some documentation will be
   written in the future and financial contributions would certainly
   reduce the waiting considerably.

1996.09.24

Q: None of the programs do anything, they all crash as soon
   as they get started!

A: We have received reports of configuration problems relating
   to a GNU C++ library libiostream.a.  This library was part
   of older (pre 2.7 ??) releases and is incompatible with newer
   versions of the GNU C++ library.  It seems that when installing
   a newer version of the GNU C++ library the old libiostream.a
   library does not get removed.  If our configuration scripts
   find this library then it will be used.

   The problem manifests itself by causing any compiled program
   to immediately crash as soon as it tries to do any C++ streams
   based I/O.

   A workaround is to remove or rename the libiostream.a library.
   Alternatively, you can edit the file dcmtk/config/Makefile.def
   after install Step 2 (running the configure script) and remove
   any reference to -liostream.a
