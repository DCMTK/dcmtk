Configuration of the different Modules
======================================

The following files in the config-directory are used for the
configuration of the modules:

confmod.in      definition of configuration tests for modules
confmod         created configure for modules
general.m4      general configuration tests (see config.txt)
Makefile.def    general default Makefile definitions for all modules
                generated with the config configure.
Makefile.x      X-Window definitions for modules Makefiles, generated
                with the config configure
templates/configure.mod
                configure for the modules directories, must be copied
                to the main module directory (see dirstruc.txt).
include/dcmtk/config/cfunix.h
                Definition that must be includes into the modules
                source files, generated with the config configure.

configure.mod must be copied to the modules main directory. The name
should be configure.

Modules configure
=================

This configure script runs the modules configure and (using special
options) the man configure script in the config directory:

Syntax:
        configure [-a|-c] <configure-options>

Purpose:
        Without options this script calls confmod in the config
        directory to make the configuration for the Makefiles in the
        module.
        Using -a mean that first the configure in the config directory
        is called and then confmod. With -c only the configure in the
        config directory is started. The configure options are passed
        to the called scripts.
        To determine the config directory the script searches from the
        local directory to the root to find a directory named config.
        The output of the confmod script (*.cache, *.status, *.log)
        ist stored in the modules directory. It is impossible to call
        confmod from the config directory.

confmod.in stores the configurations that must be used in the modules
and not in the config directory. Mainly this is used to define
variable that specify the config-directory, the default Makefile and
the X-Window Makefile template.

Modules Makefiles:
=================

Every Makefile in the modules directory must have the following lines:

@SET_MAKE@

SHELL = /bin/sh
VPATH = @srcdir@:@top_srcdir@/include:@top_srcdir@/@configdir@/include
srcdir = @srcdir@
top_srcdir = @top_srcdir@
configdir = @top_srcdir@/@configdir@

include $(configdir)/@common_makefile@

See the Makefile.* in the config/templates directory.

If your program uses X-Window calls the next line after the include of
the common makefile must be

include $(configdir)/@x_makefile@
