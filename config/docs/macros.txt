===================================
DCMTK COMPILE TIME FLAGS AND MACROS
===================================

The behavior of several DCMTK tools and libraries can be modified by
a number of compile time flags (macros), which are explained below.
Most of these macros enable experimental or rarely needed features
in DCMTK, others disable certain functions.  So please, use with care!

ALLOW_ILLUMINATION_OVERRIDE
  Affected: dcmprscu
  Type of modification: Activates experimental or rarely used feature
  Explanation: Allows the settings for Illumination and Reflected
    Ambient Light, which are stored in a Stored Print object, to be
    overridden from the print job command file.

BUGGY_IMPLEMENTATION_CLASS_UID_PREFIX
  Affected: storescp
  Type of modification: Activates workaround for known bug in other product
  Explanation: The dcmnet module contains a workaround that allows to
    communicate with some buggy Storage SCUs.  If the global flag
    dcmPeerRequiresExactUIDCopy is enabled, an illegal space padding in
    the Affected SOP Instance UID field of the C-STORE-RQ message is
    retained in the corresponding C-STORE-RSP message.  When this
    preprocessor macro is defined, it should contain the prefix of an
    implementation class UID of an implementation known to exhibit the
    buggy behavior.  The workaround is then activated in storescp
    whenever a Storage SCU with the given implementation class UID root
    connects.

DCMTK_BUILD_DATE
  Affected: dcmdata
  Type of modification: Toolkit customization
  Explanation: When this macro is defined (typically in config/Makefile.def),
    the given date is used instead of the official DCMTK release data.  This
    allows for example to specify the date of a current development snapshot.

DCMTK_BUILD_IN_PROGRESS
  Affected: all modules
  Type of modification: Toolkit customization
  Explanation: When building DLLs, exported symbols must be marked differently
    if the DLL itself is built or when the DLL shall be used.  This macro is
    defined when the DCMTK gets built and should not be defined when user code
    that just uses the DCMTK is built.  Based on this, the correct annotation
    gets selected and is used in the code.  There should be no valid reasons to
    define this macro yourself since this is done automatically by the build
    system.

DCMTK_ENABLE_UNSAFE_VSNPRINTF
  Affected: ofstd
  Type of modification: Activates feature
  Explanation: DCMTK requires the snprintf(3)/vsnprintf(3) function, which
    was introduced with C99 and may not be supported by very old compilers.
    As a "last resort", an implementation interally using sprintf/vsprintf
    can be enabled with this macro, which allows the user to compile DCMTK
    on platforms that do not have the new functions.
    The implementation allocates a buffer that is 1 kByte larger than
    the "size" parameter, formats the string into that buffer, and then
    uses strlcpy() to copy the formatted string into the output buffer,
    truncating if necessary.
    This will work in most cases, since few snprintf calls should overrun
    their buffer by more than 1K, but it can be easily abused by
    a malicious attacker to cause a buffer overrun.
    Therefore, this implementation should only be used as a "last resort"
    and we strongly advise against using it in production code.

DCMTK_GUI
  Affected: all modules
  Type of modification: Activates experimental or rarely used feature
  Explanation: When this macro is defined, DCMTK re-assigns the standard
    output and error streams maintained by ofConsole to string streams.
    This will allow a GUI based application to extract the messages and
    either present them to the user or store them in a log file.  See
    comments in ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/ofconsol.h.

DCMTK_LOG4CPLUS_AVOID_WIN32_FLS
  Affected: oflog
  Type of modification: Disables feature
  Explanation: Starting with release 3.6.5, DCMTK uses fiber local storage
    instead of thread local storage in the oflog module on Windows to store
    thread-specific information.  This has the advantage that a callback can
    be (and is) registered that automatically cleans up the memory when a
    thread ends.  The old behaviour can be re-activated with this macro.
    This may be necessary when an application wants to use multiple fibers
    within a single thread.  In that case, before ending a thread,
    dcmtk::log4cplus::threadCleanup() should be called by the user code in
    order to clean-up oflog's thread local storage.

DICOMDIR_WITHOUT_BACKUP
  Affected: dcmdata
  Type of modification: Disables feature
  Explanation: By default, DCMTK creates a backup of an existing DICOMDIR
    (using the name DICOMDIR.$$$) when a DcmDicomDir object is written
    to file.  The creation of the backup can be disabled with this macro.

DISABLE_COMPRESSION_EXTENSION
  Affected: dcmqrdb
  Type of modification: Disables feature
  Explanation: Disables the support of compression (various transfer
    syntaxes) in dcmqrdb, a feature which is still experimental.

DISABLE_FF_JPEG_BITSTREAM_PADDING
  Affected: dcmjpeg, dcmjpls
  Type of modification: Disables feature
  Explanation: Starting with release 3.6.2, DCMTK pads JPEG and JPEG-LS
    bitstreams that have odd length with an "extended" end of image (EOI)
    marker, writing ff/ff/d9 instead of adding a zero byte after the
    EOI marker, i.e. writing ff/d9/00. The old behaviour can be restored
    by defining this macro.

DISABLE_NAGLE_ALGORITHM
  Affected: dcmnet
  Type of modification: Disables feature
  Explanation: By default, DCMTK does not disable the so-called Nagle
    algorithm, which allows for improving the efficiency of TCP/IP networks
    by reducing the number of packets that need to be sent over the network.
    When compiled with this macro, the Nagle algorithm is disabled for each
    DICOM transport connection. This was the default in earlier versions of
    the DCMTK but does not seem to be appropriate anymore for most modern
    operating systems. The default behavior can be changed by setting the
    environment variable TCP_NODELAY accordingly (see config/docs/envvars.txt
    or /usr/local/share/doc/dcmtk/envvars.txt).

DISABLE_OFSTD_ATOF
  Affected: all modules
  Type of modification: Disables feature
  Explanation: By default, DCMTK uses its own implementation of atof()
    to convert strings to double numbers in a locale-independent manner.
    This flag forces DCMTK to use the standard sscanf() function
    instead, which is normally much faster and gives a higher precision
    than DCMTK's built in code, but is locale dependent, i.e. cannot be
    used with locales such as German since DICOM decimal strings always
    use the Posix locale.

DISABLE_OFSTD_FTOA
  Affected: all modules
  Type of modification: Disables feature
  Explanation: By default, DCMTK uses its own implementation to convert
    double numbers to strings to in a locale-independent manner.
    This flag forces DCMTK to use the standard sprintf() function
    instead, which is locale dependent, i.e. cannot be used with locales
    such as German since DICOM decimal strings always use the Posix
    locale.

DISABLE_PORT_PERMISSION_CHECK
  Affected: most/all network server tools
  Type of modification: Disables feature
  Explanation: By default, most network server tools (e.g. storescp) check
    for sufficient privileges to listen on the specified port (if geteuid()
    is available on the particular system).  For examples, on Unix systems
    listening on port < 1024 usually requires root privileges.  However,
    the port permission check might prevent the tool from being run on such
    ports on systems with fine-grained permission control (e.g. Linux).
    Therefore, this check can be disabled using this flag.

DISABLE_RECV_TIMEOUT
  This macro is not supported anymore since the timeout for the recv() function
  is now configurable at runtime.  See global variable dcmSocketReceiveTimeout.

DISABLE_SEND_TIMEOUT
  This macro is not supported anymore since the timeout for the send() function
  is now configurable at runtime.  See global variable dcmSocketSendTimeout.

DONT_DISABLE_NAGLE_ALGORITHM
  This macro is not supported anymore since the Nagle algorithm is no longer
  disabled by default.  See DISABLE_NAGLE_ALGORITHM for details.

DONT_LOAD_EXTERNAL_DICTIONARIES
  This macro is not supported anymore since it has been superseded by macro
  ENABLE_EXTERNAL_DICTIONARY.  See ENABLE_EXTERNAL_DICTIONARY for details.

DOXYGEN
  Affected: everything
  Type of modification: Hides complexity from Doxygen
  Explanation: Doxygen is unable to parse some complex statements correctly
    and it is sometimes sufficient to provide documentation for the basic
    functionality instead of documenting every detail.
    This macro is defined when creating the documentation with Doxygen and
    should NEVER be defined when compiling DCMTK with a C/C++ compiler.
    NOTE: Doxygen is still unable to expand some macros correctly
    (e.g. HAVE_WINDOWS_H). Using this macro at the appropriate locations
    could be a solution for this problem.

ENABLE_BUILTIN_DICTIONARY
  Affected: dcmdata
  Type of modification: Activates feature
  Explanation: If enabled, DCMTK's global builtin dictionary, that is always
    loaded on startup, is populated with known DICOM tags.  Otherwise, the
    builtin dictionary stays empty.  For further information about dictionary
    configuration read dcmdata/docs/datadict.txt.

ENABLE_EXTERNAL_DICTIONARY
  Affected: dcmdata
  Type of modification: Enables feature
  Explanation: DCMTK is able to load DICOM data dictionaries from files at
    application start (before the main function is called).  These files
    are either specified by the DCMDICTPATH environment variable or the
    default files are used.  This flag enables the loading of external
    dictionaries from file at application start.  Disabling it might be useful
    when only the builtin dictionary should be used.  However, if no
    dictionary gets loaded, this is likely to cause unexpected behavior.
    Even if this flag is disabled, the reloadDictionaries() method can be
    used to load the external dictionaries after application start.
    However, the environment variable DCMDICTPATH has to point to one or more
    related dictionary files in that case, since if ENABLE_EXTERNAL_DICTIONARY
    is disabled, no default dictionary path is set within the DCMTK code.
    On Unix-like systems this flag is enabled by default while on Windows it is
    disabled.  For more information about dictionary configuration read
    dcmdata/docs/datadict.txt.
    Note that in former versions of DCMTK a macro called
    DONT_LOAD_EXTERNAL_DICTIONARIES has been specified which now has been
    replaced with ENABLE_EXTERNAL_DICTIONARY in order to be consistent with
    the existing Autoconf and CMake configuration switches. See also entry for
    DONT_LOAD_EXTERNAL_DICTIONARIES.

EXPERIMENTAL_READ_FROM_FILE
  Affected: dump2dcm
  Type of modification: Activates experimental or rarely used feature
  Explanation: When this macro is defined, the relatively new function
    createValueFromTempFile() is used for reading large binary data files.

LOCK_IMAGE_FILES
  Affected: dcmpstat, dcmqrdb
  Type of modification: Activates experimental or rarely used feature
  Explanation: When this macro is defined, the DICOM image file to be
    send or received/created is locked exclusively.

LOG4CPLUS_DISABLE_xxx
(where xxx is one of TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR and FATAL)
  Affected: oflog
  Type of modification: Disables feature
  Explanation: When one of these macros is defined all log message of
    this type and lower are disabled and optimized away.

NO_GET_SUPPORT
  Affected: dcmqrdb
  Type of modification: Disables feature
  Explanation: Disables the experimental C-GET support in dcmqrdb.

NO_PATIENTSTUDYONLY_SUPPORT
  Affected: dcmqrdb
  Type of modification: Disables feature
  Explanation: Disables support for the Patient/Study Only Query/Retrieve
    Model in dcmqrdb.

OFCONDITION_IMPLICIT_BOOL_CONVERSION
  Affected: ofstd
  Type of modification: Activates experimental or rarely used feature
  Explanation: Activates an implicit conversion from OFCondition to
    OFBool, i.e. operator OFBool().  Implicit conversion might not always
    be a good idea since it can hide unwanted constructs.  Therefore,
    this operator is disabled by default.

ON_THE_FLY_COMPRESSION
  Affected: storescu
  Type of modification: Activates experimental or rarely used feature
  Explanation: When this macro is defined, the storescu tries to compress
    or decompress the DICOM image to be sent (if required) depending on
    the negotiated transfer syntax.

OLD_USER_INFO_SUB_ITEM_ORDER
  Affected: dcmnet
  Type of modification: Activates experimental or rarely used feature
  Explanation: Prior DCMTK releases did not encode A-ASSOCIATE user
    information sub-items in ascending order, i.e. they sent 55H
    followed by 54H and 56H.  This behavior has been "legalized" by
    DICOM CP 280 but is known to create problems with some other
    toolkits.  The current DCMTK release always sends the user
    information sub-items in ascending order, but can be "forced" with
    this macro to revert to the old behavior.  It should be re-activated
    for testing purposes only.

PASTEL_COLOR_OUTPUT
  Affected: dcmimgle, dcmimage
  Type of modification: Activates experimental or rarely used feature
  Explanation: Activates experimental code in dcmimgle/dcmimage that
    renders monochrome images with pastel colors.

PDV_TEST
  Affected: dcmnet
  Type of modification: Activates experimental or rarely used feature
  Explanation: Causes the network module to insert a false, zero-length
    PDV (2 byte header) into each P-DATA-PDU.

PIXELSTACK_MEMORY_LEAK_WORKAROUND
  Affected: dcmdata
  Type of modification: Activates experimental or rarely used feature
  Explanation: On certain platforms there seems to be a memory leak in
    DcmDataset::chooseRepresentation().  The work-around activated by
    this macro should solve this issue.

PRINT_REPLACED_DICTIONARY_ENTRIES
  Affected: dcmdata
  Type of modification: Activates experimental or rarely used feature
  Explanation: When reading the data dictionary, duplicate entries (i.e.
    entries replacing an older entry in the dictionary) are reported on
    console if compiled with this macro.  Useful for testing a new
    dictionary version.

REJECT_FILE_IF_META_GROUP_LENGTH_ABSENT
  Affected: dcmdata
  Type of modification: Disables feature
  Explanation: When reading the a file that contains an incorrect meta
    header where meta header group length (0002,0000) is absent, DCMTK
    since release 3.5.4 nevertheless tries to parse the file, unless this
    macro is enabled, in which case the behavior up to DCMTK 3.5.3 is
    retained.

RETAIN_ASSOCIATION
  Affected: dcmqrti
  Type of modification: Activates experimental or rarely used feature
  Explanation: Keeps association to remote Query SCP open after
    study/series/image listing.  Default behavior is to open new
    association for each query.

REVERSE_OVERLAY_ORIGIN_ORDER
  Affected: dcmimgle
  Type of modification: Activates experimental or rarely used feature
  Explanation: When compiled with this macro, dcmimgle assumes that the
    values in DCM_ImageFrameOrigin are in reverse order, i.e. X\Y
    instead of Y\X.

SITE_UID_ROOT
  Affected: dcmdata
  Type of modification: Site customization
  Explanation: dcmdata contains a routine that generates DICOM unique
    identifiers (UIDs).  By default, these are constructed from the OFFIS
    UID namespace, i.e. using the OFFIS UID Root "1.2.276.0.7230010.3".
    Users who prefer to let the toolkit generate UIDs from their own UID
    namespace should compile DCMTK with SITE_UID_ROOT defined to their own
    UID root.  Please make sure that the resulting UIDs do not exceed the
    64 characters limit!

STARVIEW
  Affected: dcmimgle, dcmimage
  Type of modification: Activates experimental or rarely used feature
  Explanation: Enables support for old StarView 2 GUI class library from
    Star Division.

SUPPRESS_CREATE_STAMP
  Affected: dcmdata
  Type of modification: Activates experimental or rarely used feature
  Explanation: When defined, suppresses the creation of a time stamp
    comment when re-generating dcdeftag.h and dcdictbi.cc.

USE__LOCKING
  Affected: dcmnet
  Type of modification: Activates alternative implementation
  Explanation: Activates an alternative emulation of flock() on Win32
    platforms using _locking().  This version should only be used on
    compilers where _get_osfhandle() is not available since it does not
    implement shared locks.

USE_BINARY_MODE_FOR_STDOUT_ON_WINDOWS
  Affected: dcmdata
  Type of modification: Activates experimental or rarely used feature
  Explanation: On Windows systems, the standard output (stdout) is opened in
    text mode by default.  Therefore, the binary output of tools like dcm2pnm
    to stdout does not work correctly (in contrast to Unix systems).  When
    this preprocessor macro is defined, the binary mode is enabled for stdout.
    However, this causes newlines in the textual output to be converted to LF
    only (instead of CR LF which would be the usual translation for Windows).

USE_NULL_SAFE_OFSTRING
  Affected: ofstd
  Type of modification: Activates feature
  Explanation: When this macro is defined, OFString(NULL) results in an
    empty string.  If this macro is not defined, OFString(NULL) causes a
    NULL pointer dereference.  This macro has no effect when HAVE_STL_STRING
    is also defined.  Currently, this macro is always defined by DCMTK's
    Makefiles.  This will change in future releases.

USE_WIN32_CREATE_MUTEX
  Affected: ofstd
  Type of modification: Activates alternative implementation
  Explanation: Starting with DCMTK 3.6.2, the Win32 version of the
    OFMutex class uses critical sections instead of Win32 mutexes, because
    critical sections are much faster. Their only drawback is that they
    cannot be shared across processes. Users who want to revert to the
    behavior of older DCMTK releases can define this macro.

USE_WIN32_READ_WRITE_LOCK_HELPER
  Affected: ofstd
  Type of modification: Re-activated behavior of earlier DCMTK releases
  Explanation: Starting with DCMTK 3.6.4, the Win32 version of the
    OFReadWriteLock class uses Slim Reader/Writer (SRW) Locks,
    which are available since Windows Vista, instead of the older
    implementation based on a Mutex, a Semaphore and a counter, because
    SRW locks are much faster. Users who want to revert to the
    behavior of older DCMTK releases can define this macro.

USING_STD_NAMESPACE
  Affected: all modules
  Type of modification: Re-activated behavior of earlier DCMTK releases
  Explanation: DCMTK by default does not anymore pollute the default namespace
    by importing namespace std.  Earlier releases did this to simplify
    compatibility with older compilers where STL classes were not consistently
    defined in namespace std.  We now have configure macros which should care
    for this.  If user code still relies on namespace std to be included,
    compile with this macro defined.

WIDE_CHAR_FILE_IO_FUNCTIONS
  Affected: ofstd
  Type of modification: Activates feature
  Explanation: In addition to the standard file I/O functions, the OFFile class
    also defines the corresponding wide character functions from C99 standard.
    Since these functions are not yet supported by all compilers and the
    current implementation is Windows-specific, this feature is disabled by
    default.  When using CMake, you can enable this macro by setting the CMake
    option DCMTK_WIDE_CHAR_FILE_IO_FUNCTIONS to "on".

WIDE_CHAR_MAIN_FUNCTION
  Affected: currently not used
  Type of modification: Activates experimental or rarely used feature
  Explanation: On Windows (at least for MSVC), a different main function has
    to be used in order to get the command line arguments with wide character
    encoding (UTF-16).  By defining this flag, the macro DCMTK_MAIN_FUNCTION
    expands to wmain() instead of main().  When using CMake, you can enable
    this macro by setting the CMake option DCMTK_WIDE_CHAR_MAIN_FUNCTION to
    "on".  Usually, WIDE_CHAR_FILE_IO_FUNCTIONS should also be enabled.

WRITE_VERY_LARGE_CHUNKS
  Affected: dcmdata
  Type of modification: Re-activated behavior of earlier DCMTK releases
  Explanation: On Windows (at least for some versions of MSVC), calls to
    fwrite() for more than 67,076,095 bytes (a bit less than 64 MByte) fail if
    we're writing to a network share.  See MSDN KB899149.  As a workaround, we
    always write in chunks of 32M which should hardly negatively affect
    performance.  This macro enables the behavior of earlier DCMTK releases,
    i.e. to always call fwrite with as much data as possible, which is known
    not to work correctly on Win32 but might offer very minor performance
    benefits on other platforms.

ZLIB_ENCODE_RFC1950_HEADER
  Affected: dcmdata
  Type of modification: Activates experimental or rarely used feature
  Explanation: When this macro is defined, the deflated ZLIB format is created
    instead of the deflated bitstream format (i.e. RFC 1950 instead of RFC
    1951). Please note that the resulting bitstream is not DICOM compliant.
    So, use only for testing, and use with care!
