In earlier versions of DCMTK, changes between releases had been documented in a
CHANGES.XXX file inside DCMTK's main directory, with "XXX" referring to the
version number of the release.

Now, the CHANGES.XXX file has been moved to the dcmtk/docs folder (in the
source code package) with the latest one being updated every time a new DCMTK
version is released.  Thus, it always contains all DCMTK changes between the
previous DCMTK release and the most recent one.

For very recent changes, i. e. those changes to DCMTK that have been applied
after the most recent release, see the commit history of DCMTK's git repository
at https://git.dcmtk.org/.
