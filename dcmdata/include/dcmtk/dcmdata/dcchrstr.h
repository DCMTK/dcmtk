// character sets are supported by the class DcmByteString the class
// DcmCharString is derived from DcmByteString without any extensions.
//
// If the extension for 16 bit character sets will be implemented, this class
// must be derived directly from DcmElement. This class is designed to support
// the value representations (LO, LT, PN, SH, ST, UC and UT). They are a problem
// because their value width (1, 2, ... bytes) is specified by the element
// SpecificCharacterSet (0008,0005) and an implementation must support
// different value widths that cannot be derived from the value representation.
