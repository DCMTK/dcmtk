DICOM DATA DICTIONARY IN DCMTK
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In DICOM, the Data Dictionary (part 6 of the DICOM standard) stores for all
attribute tags their respective VR, VM, name and other information.  This
information must also be made available in DCMTK.  This is accomplished
through a global data dictionary class.

The global data dictionary is loaded within a C++ constructor into the global
DcmDataDictionary class instance called dcmDataDict once it is accessed for
the first time from the code.  The initial dictionary content is populated by
two different approaches:

1. builtin: The content (tags, VR, ...) is compiled into the dictionary code.
2. external: The dictionary is filled by loading a default text file on
   startup from a pre-defined file path.

It is also possible to not load any default dictionary on startup at all
(option "disable" or setting "none", see below).

The built-in approach offers the advantage that a binary will not have to
load any information from a separate file, which may get lost or used in an
outdated version.  Loading the dictionary content from a separate file,
however, has the advantage that application programs need not be recompiled
if additions or corrections are made to the data dictionary.

By default, DCMTK uses an external data dictionary on Posix systems (Linux,
Mac OS X, etc.) while a built-in dictionary is used on Windows systems.  How
these defaults can be changed or how both approaches can even be combined is
further explained below.

There is also an option to evaluate the environment variable DCMDICTPATH and
to read dictionaries defined therein, see below for details.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DICTIONARY DEFAULT: AUTOCONF ON POSIX SYSTEMS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

By default, on a Posix system the global data dictionary will attempt to load
the data dictionary from an external file.  The location is pre-configured
to $DCMTK_DAT_DIR/dicom.dic where $DCMTK_DAT_DIR is DCMTK's data installation
directory chosen using configure's --datadir option (default value: /dcmtk).
See also --datarootdir and --prefix options.  The resulting path is stored as
DCM_DICT_DEFAULT_PATH in the file config/include/dcmtk/config/osconfig.h,
which is created by Autoconf during the execution of the configure script and
thus is available to the dictionary code that includes osconfig.h.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DICTIONARY DEFAULT: CMAKE ON WINDOWS AND POSIX SYSTEMS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

On Windows, the default behavior is to compile a fully-populated built-in data
dictionary as a global data dictionary into the dcmdata library.  Thus, it is
not required to load an external data dictionary from a file.

On Posix systems, the default setting when using CMake is to load the data
dictionary from an external file (as described in the above section on
Autoconf).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGING DICTIONARY DEFAULTS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Autoconf as well as CMake provide options to change their default dictionary
behavior.  For Autoconf, there are two different options.  The first one is:

  --enable-default-dict=TYPE

Possible values for TYPE are:

  "external": Compile with external default dictionary
  "builtin" : Compile with built-in default dictionary

With the second option, the default dictionary can be disabled:

  --disable-default-dict

When building with CMake, the related option is:

  - DCMTK_DEFAULT_DICT

Possible values for this option are:

  "external": Compile with external default dictionary
  "builtin" : Compile with built-in default dictionary
  "none"    : Compile without any default dictionary (same as "disable")

That means, both Autoconf and CMake provide the same functionality.  On Posix
systems "external" is the default value, while on Windows it is "builtin".

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CUSTOM EXTERNAL DICTIONARIES THROUGH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE "DCMDICTPATH"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes it makes sense to change the dictionary that should be loaded
without recompiling the source code.  This can be done either by modifying
the dicom.dic that is already loaded (if using 'external' standard dictionary)
or by specifying a different location in an environment variable that is
evaluated on DCMTK startup.  This environment variable is called "DCMDICTPATH"
and can be used on Windows and Posix systems.

If DCMDICTPATH is not set, the behavior described in the sections above takes
place (built-in or external dictionary from default path is loaded).
Otherwise, the file provided in the environment variable DCMDICTPATH is loaded
and any default external dictionary is ignored (!).  Note, however, that the
built-in dictionary (if configured) is always loaded.

In order to set DCMDICTPATH on Unix, the csh shell command

  setenv DCMDICTPATH $HOME/dicom.dic

would cause all applications using the dcmdata library to load the data
dictionary dicom.dic from the user's home directory.  When using the bash,
the command is:

  export DCMDICTPATH=$HOME/dicom.dic

For Windows, the call

  set DCMDICTPATH=c:\dicom.dic

will cause all applications using the dcmdata library to load the data
dictionary dicom.dic from the main directory on drive C.

It is possible to completely disable the evaluation of DCMDICTPATH (e.g. for
security reasons).  The related configure options controlling this behavior
are the following:

  --enable-dcmdictpath (default)
  --disable-dcmdictpath

When building with CMake, the related option is:

  - DCMTK_USE_DCMDICTPATH (on/off, default: on)

By default, DCMDICTPATH evaluation is enabled on both on Windows and Posix
systems.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DICTIONARY LOAD ORDER AND USING MULTIPLE DICTIONARIES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The load behavior is slightly different for built-in and external default
dictionaries:

If the built-in dictionary is enabled, it will be loaded first on startup.
DCMTK then checks whether DCMDICTPATH should be evaluated (see above) and, if
it is set and provides a non-empty value, DCMTK will load all additional
dictionaries on top of the built-in default dictionary.

If instead the external default dictionary is enabled and DCMDICTPATH
evaluation is turned off, the external default dictionary will be loaded.

However, if DCMDICTPATH evaluation is enabled and the environment variable
provides a (non-empty) value, DCMTK will load the dictionary denoted by
DCMDICTPATH and will not load the external default dictionary at all.

It is not possible to enable both external and built-in default dictionary at
the same time.

If the user decides to use no default dictionary at all by defining
(DCMTK_DEFAULT_DICT=none), it is still possible to define a dictionary by
using the DCMDICTPATH mechanism.  If DCMTK_USE_DCMDICTPATH is turned off
as well, no dictionary is loaded on startup and the user must populate
the dictionary using his own code during runtime.

Application programs should check that a data dictionary has been loaded
before using the functionality of the dcmdata library.  The absence of
a data dictionary is likely to cause unexpected behavior (e.g. unknown
attributes will be encoded using VR=UN).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
USING MORE THAN ONE EXTERNAL DICTIONARY
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The DCMDICTPATH environment variable can even refer to several data
dictionaries separated by colons (":") on Unix systems, or semicolons (";")
on Windows systems.  Thus the Unix csh command

  setenv DCMDICTPATH /usr/local/share/dcmtk/dicom.dic:$HOME/dicom.dic

would cause all applications using the dcmdata library to first load the
default data dictionary and subsequently load the data dictionary dicom.dic
from the user's home directory.  When using the bash, the command would be:

  export DCMDICTPATH=/usr/local/share/dcmtk/dicom.dic:$HOME/dicom.dic

On Windows systems, the command would be:

  set DCMDICTPATH=c:\dcmtk-install\share\dcmtk\dicom.dic;c:\dicom.dic

Also here, data dictionary entries loaded later in the load sequence override
entries loaded earlier.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DATA DICTIONARIES INCLUDED IN DCMTK (DICOM.DIC, PRIVATE.DIC AND BUILT-IN)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

An example DICOM data dictionary can be found in dcmdata/data/dicom.dic,
which is also installed (using Autoconf or CMake) and used as the default
external dictionary (if external default dictionary is enabled).

The example data dictionary is meant to be complete and includes all standard
and retired attributes from part 6 of the DICOM standard (see the header of
the file where the implemented version of the standard plus all supplements
and CPs are listed).  Also contained, since they are included in part 6, are
the official DICONDE (Digital Imaging and Communication in Nondestructive
Evaluation) and DICOS (Digital Imaging and Communications in Security)
attributes.

Another example dictionary included is the dcmdata/data/private.dic, which
includes all private tag information known to DCMTK developers and partly
taken over from other DICOM toolkits and various other sources like DICOM
Conformance Statements.  There is no guarantee that the information contained
is valid or even complete.  By default, this dictionary is not taken into
account.  It can be enabled to load on startup as an extra external dictionary
using Autoconf's configure option --enable-private-tags and in CMake using the
option DCMTK_ENABLE_PRIVATE_TAGS.  Enabling will result in private.dic being
added to the DCM_DICT_DEFAULT_PATH, which lists those external dictionaries to
be loaded on startup (see above).  Note that the private tag option is only
considered for external dictionaries if external dictionaries are not disabled.

DCMTK also includes two predefined built-in dictionaries, one fully populated
containing the information from DCMTK's dicom.dic file (and possibly from the
private.dic file if enabled, see next paragraph), and one that is empty.  Both
are defined in dcdictbi.cc and the one to be used is selected by the dictionary
build options (see above).

The code for a useful built-in data dictionary can be regenerated at any time
by the mkdictbi program (dcmdata/libsrc/mkdictbi).  The dcmdata library
Makefiles (for Autoconf dcmdata/libsrc/Makefile.in, and for CMake
dcmdata/libsrc/CMakeLists.txt) provide a target (updatebuiltindict) for this
purpose.  After regenerating dcdictbi.cc, rebuilding the dcmdata library and
relinking all applications will ensure that the built-in data dictionary is
used.  This dictionary contains all definitions from the dicom.dic and
private.dic file.  Please note, however, that the latter is only available if
support for private tags has been enabled during DCMTK configuration and thus
ENABLE_PRIVATE_TAGS is defined in osconfig.h.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TAG NAME CONSTANTS FOR USE IN APPLICATIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The include file dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dcdeftag.h can be generated
from a data dictionary by the program mkdeftag.  The include file defines
attribute tag names for use in application programs.  The names are generated
from the official keywords specified in the data dictionary.  Duplicate names
in the data dictionary will result in compiler warnings due to duplicate
#define's when compiling code that includes the dcdeftag.h header file.
Thus, when adding new entries to the data dictionary, care should be taken to
ensure that attribute names are not duplicated for distinct tags.

The dcmdata library Makefiles (for Autoconf dcmdata/libsrc/Makefile.in and for
CMake dcmdata/libsrc/CMakeLists.txt) include a target (updatedeftag) that
builds the mkdeftag tool and uses it to generate the
dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dcdeftag.h header file.  The header file should
be regenerated whenever additions or name modifications are made to the data
dictionary.  Care should be taken before modifying any tag names since
existing application programs may already use the old name and might
subsequently fail to compile.
