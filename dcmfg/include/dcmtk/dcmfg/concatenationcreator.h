/** Class for creating Concatenations from existing SOP Instances.
 *  As input, a user can either provide a full SOP Instance with Pixel Data
 *  attribute, or a SOP Instance plus separate pixel data as a vector of frame data.
 *  The input file is uncompressed if necessary and possible, and the resulting
 *  concatenation instances will also contain uncompressed pixel data.
 *  During conversion, the original source pixel data is held into memory and
 *  additionally one of the concatenation instances the moment it is being produced
 *  when calling writeNextInstance() (see below).
 *  The following workflow must be used to create a Concatenation:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>Call to one of the setCfgInput() methods in order to set the concatenation
 *  source data, i.e. the SOP Instance that should be split into a number of
 *  concatenation instances.</li>
 *  <li>Call to other setCfg...() calls in order to set conversion options. For example
 *  the number of frames per concatenation instance produced can be configured by calling
 *  setCfgFramesPerInstance(). Per default, 25 frames per instance are being used.</li>
 *  <li>Call to one of the writeNextInstance() methods in order to write the next
 *  concatenation instance.</li>
 *  <li>Call to the load() method in order to load of the the Concatenations found
 *  during scan(). Selection is done via the Concatenations Concatenation UID.
 *  The result is made available as a single, merged dataset without Pixel Data attribute
 *  and a vector containing all frames of the merged instance.</li>
 * </ul>
