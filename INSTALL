==================================
DICOM TOOLKIT (DCMTK) INSTALLATION
==================================

PRE-REQUISITES
==============

The DICOM ToolKit (DCMTK) needs to be compiled with a C++ compiler.
We recommend using the GNU-C++ compiler in versions higher than 2.7
(most of the development was done using GNU-C++ 2.95 on Solaris 7).
The software is also known to compile using the SUNPro C++ compiler,
the IBM C Set++ compiler and the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.

Compatibility with other C++ compilers is unknown, however, we have
tried to keep language demands to a minimum (newer C++ features such
as ANSI C++ Library, Exceptions and RTTI have been avoided).

You will need between 100Mb and 250Mb of disk space to compile all
the software.


SUPPORTED SYSTEMS
=================

Windows 95/98/2000/NT
---------------------

The DCMTK software can be compiled under a native Windows95/NT environment
(see section "BUILDING (Win32)" below for more information).

    Windows NT 4.0 / Intel x86 / Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0
    Windows NT 4.0 / Intel x86 / Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0
    Windows 2000   / Intel x86 / Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0
    Windows 2000   / Intel x86 / Microsoft Visual C++ .NET

The imagectn and wlistctn (now: wlmscpfs) have been ported to Windows, but do
not support multi-processing (i.e. multiple clients concurrently) under
Windows. The Worklist WWW Scripts require an http server and a perl interpreter
and have not been tested under Windows (file locking interaction with the
wlistctn/wlmscpfs server may or may not work).

    Windows 9x     / Intel x86       / Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0

Platform Notes
--------------

(*1) The NeXT gcc 2.5.8 compiler provides only very limited support for C++
     templates and, therefore, might fail to compile the dcmimage/dcmimgle
     module ("internal compiler error").  The gcc compiler also does not
     properly  support the "protected" derivation of classes which is used in
     the dcmsr module.  However, modules and applications that were present in
     earlier releases of DCMTK still compile.
(*2) The dcmimage/dcmimgle module makes intensive use of inlined templates.
     Depending on the compiler and the available virtual memory, compilation
     might fail if this module is compiled with optimization.  Compilation
     succeeds if the optimizer and any automatic inlining of code are switched
     off.  For example Gnu gcc might require that the -O option is removed and
     -fno-default-inline is added in the CXXFLAGS setting in the file
     config/Makefile.def, which is created by configure (see below).
(*3) Requires -fpermissive when compiled with gcc due to the X11R5 header
     files which are not ANSI compliant.
(*4) IRIX 6 users are recommended to consult SGI's Notes on building
     Open Source software on IRIX, available from:
     http://toolbox.sgi.com/TasteOfDT/public/freeware/shared/howto.html
     In short, after running configure, the following modifications are required
     in config/Makefile.def before DCMTK can be compiled:
       - remove "-lsocket -lnsl" from LIBS
     On IRIX, DCMTK should be built using GNU make (gmake), not with the IRIX
     specific pmake/smake/make commands.
(*5) MacOS X 10.1 requires DCMTK to be configured with --disable-threads
     because certain re-entrant Posix functions such as localtime_r
     are not available.

Please note: Due to resource limitations it is not practical for us to
ensure that the newest release of DCMTK is problem free under all the above
combinations.  Our main development environment is SUN Solaris 7 using GNU
C++ 2.95.3 and DCMTK should always compile on this platform.


OPENSSL SUPPORT
===============

Starting with release 3.4.2, DCMTK supports the "DICOM Security Enhancements
One", i.e. DICOM network transmission "tunneled" through a secure TLSv1
transport connection.  DCMTK relies on the OpenSSL toolkit (www.openssl.org)
for the underlying cryptographic routines and the TLS protocol

implementation.  This release of DCMTK is known to compile with all 
0.9.6x OpenSSL releases.  Due to security considerations we recommend that
DCMTK should be compiled with OpenSSL 0.9.6g or 0.9.6h. DCMTK has not
yet been tested with OpenSSL 0.9.7.

If support for the security enhancements is desired, a compiled version of
the OpenSSL libraries and include files must be available during compilation
of DCMTK, and the OpenSSL support must be switched on explicitly.  By
default, DCMTK compiles without OpenSSL support and disables all security
enhancements.

To enable OpenSSL support when compiling for Windows, select the target 
"Win32 Release OpenSSL" in the Visual C++ workspace.  You may have to 
adapt the include paths, which expect OpenSSL in a directory named 
openssl-0.9.6g on the same directory level as the DCMTK root directory. 
To enable OpenSSL support when compiling for Unix, see description for 
Step 2 below.  We recommend that you also read the documentation in 
dcmtk/dcmtls/docs about using TLS with DCMTK.


ZLIB SUPPORT
============

Starting with release 3.5.2, DCMTK supports the "Deflated Explicit VR 
Little Endian" Transfer Syntax, i.e. ZIP-compressed network transmission 
and media storage.  DCMTK relies on the ZLIB toolkit (www.zlib.org) for 
the underlying compression routines.  Due to security considerations, we 
recommend that DCMTK should only be used with ZLIB 1.1.4 or newer.

On Unix platforms, if support for zlib compression is desired, a 
compiled version of the zlib library and include files must be available 
during compilation of DCMTK, and the ZLIB support must be switched on 
explicitly. DCMTK compiles without ZLIB support and disables ZLIB 
compression by default.

On Windows, the Visual C++ project files provided as part of the toolkit 
expect a directory named "zlib-1.1.4" to be present in the same 
directory where the DCMTK root directory (dcmtk) also resides. Include 
files are expected in zlib-1.1.4/include. A debug version of the library 
is expected in zlib-1.1.4/debug/zlib.lib, a release version in 
zlib-1.1.4/release/zlib.lib. The debug version must be compiled for the 
multithread debug version of the runtime (/MTd)", the release version 
must be compiled for the non-debug multithread runtime (/MT). A 
precompiled version of the library can be downloaded from 
http://dicom.offis.de/dcmtk/


LIBTIFF SUPPORT
===============

Starting with release 3.5.1, DCMTK supports the conversion of DICOM images
to TIFF.  DCMTK relies on the libtiff toolkit (www.libtiff.org) for this
purpose.  This release of DCMTK is known to compile with the current
libtiff release 3.5.7, although older releases may work as well.

On Unix platforms, if support for TIFF export is desired, a compiled 
version of the libtiff libraries and include files must be available 
during compilation of DCMTK, and the libtiff support must be switched on 
explicitly.  By default, DCMTK compiles without libtiff support.

On Windows, the Visual C++ project files provided as part of the toolkit 
expect a directory named "tiff-3.5.7" to be present in the same 
directory where the DCMTK root directory (dcmtk) also resides. Include 
files are expected in tiff-3.5.7/include. A debug version of the library 
is expected in tiff-3.5.7/debug/libtiff.lib, a release version in 
tiff-3.5.7/release/libtiff.lib. The debug version must be compiled for 
the multithread debug version of the runtime (/MTd)", the release 
version must be compiled for the non-debug multithread runtime (/MT). 
A precompiled version of the library can be downloaded from 
http://dicom.offis.de/dcmtk/


BUILDING (Unix)
===============

GNU autoconf is used to configure the software for the hardware / operating
system you are using.  You do not need to obtain GNU autoconf to compile
and install this software.  All the neccessary configure scripts are
included in this distribution.  The configure scripts examine your system
capabilities and automatically generate include files and Makefiles.

Perform the following steps from the top level (dcmtk) directory
to compile and install the software:

Step 1:
    cd config
    ./rootconf
    cd ..

Step 1 generates a Makefile and a configure script in the top level dcmtk
directory.

Step 2:
    ./configure

Step 2 executes the configure scripts in each subdirectory.  First the
system capabilities are examined and then Makefiles are generated.  By
default, executables and libraries will be installed (in Step 4) in the
directory /usr/local/dicom in the bin and lib subdirectories.  If you wish
to use another install prefix you can use the --prefix=<path> flag to
configure.  E.g., if you wish to install underneath your home directory in
~/dicom/bin and ~/dicom/lib then you should start configure as:

    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/dicom

Step 2 is also the place where support for OpenSSL, libtiff and zlib can 
be enabled. Use the --with-openssl switch to enable OpenSSL support. 
The --with-opensslinc option allows to specify the directory in which 
OpenSSL is installed.  This is usually the directory that has been used 
as --prefix when compiling OpenSSL. For example, if you wish to enable 
the security enhancements, and OpenSSL is installed in 
/usr/local/apps/openssl-0.9.6h, then you should start configure as:

    ./configure --with-openssl --with-opensslinc=/usr/local/apps/openssl-0.9.6h

Configure will assume that the OpenSSL include files are installed in 
/usr/local/apps/openssl-0.9.6h/include and will expect the library in 
/usr/local/apps/openssl-0.9.6h/lib. Appropriate options will be passed 
to the compiler and the linker.

Support for libtiff can be enabled in a similar way:

    ./configure --with-libtiff --with-libtiffinc=/usr/local/apps/libtiff-3.5.7

Different configure options can be combined in any order. configure --help
will print a list of all existing configure options.  Useful configure
options are:

  --enable-debug          compile with debug code, don't optimize
  --disable-debug         compile without debug code (default)
  --enable-threads=TYPE   compile with MT support (posix/solaris/auto=default)
  --disable-threads       compile without MT support
  --enable-std-includes   use C++ ANSI standard includes
  --disable-std-includes  use old C++ includes

Step 3:
    make all

Step 3 will build the libraries and executables.  If you run into problems
see the section on PROBLEMS below.

Step 4:
    make install

Step 4 will install the executables and data dictionary.  If you also wish
to install the libraries and include files then use the "make install-lib".

Step 5:
    make distclean

Step 5 will revert the source tree to the state prior to Step 1.  If you
just want to get rid of object files and local executables use "make clean"
instead.


Solving configuration and compilation problems:

The configure script might not be able to guess the correct compiler and
compiler flags to use.  For example, we have noticed that use of the
-pedantic flag to the GNU-C++ compiler causes compilation errors on some
systems (e.g. SunOS 4.1.3) due to system include files with incorrect ANSI
function prototypes.

You can set environment variables to initialize configure before it is
called (before Step 2 above):

  Set environment variable CXX to the name of your C++ compiler
  Set environment variable CXXFLAGS to the compile flags of your C++ compiler.
  Set environment variable LDFLAGS to your linker flags.
  Set environment variable CPPFLAGS to you preprocessor flags.

You do not need to specify all the above environment variables since
the default settings are sensible for most unix compilers.

If the configure script fails you may have to change the configuration
settings in the config directory.  See the config/docs directory for more
information.

See also the FAQ for more hints.


BUILDING (Win32)
================

The toolkit also contains makefiles / project files for Windows NT and
Windows 95/98/Me/2000/XP. Currently, only one configuration is supported:

- Windows NT/9x/Me/2000/XP with WINSOCK using the Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler
  Version 5.0 (project files can also be imported into Version 6.0 and .NET).

Compile instructions:

1. Rename the extensions of all .cc files into .cxx if not already done (e.g.
   "ren *.cc *.cxx" with the COMMAND shell or if you have a UNIX workstation
   available use "config/changext cxx"). You must rename files in the libsrc,
   apps and tests directories of all modules.
2. Start the Microsoft Developer Studio (IDE).
3. Open Workspace.. and select "dcmtk.dsw".
4. Select the appropriate target in the IDE: Release, Debug or Release OpenSSL.
   "Release OpenSSL" requires a pre-compiled version of the OpenSSL libary
   to be appropriately installed - see section on OpenSSL support above.
5. Choose one of the subprojects and build it. If you want to build all
   applications, mark all subprojects and select "build selection" from the
   context menu.

Known problems:

1. The imagectn and wlmscpfs (formerly known as wlistctn) cannot spark multiple
   processes. Every association must be handled completely before a new
   association is possible.
2. On Windows 95, imagectn always uses exclusive file locking (the LockFileEx
   API call is available on Windows NT only). This is no problem if only one
   single process exists.
3. Most applications will only work if the computer has configured TCP/IP, a
   network name and a TCP/IP address. If SLIP or PPP is used the applications
   can only work if a connection to a provider exists (since the internet
   addresses and names are given dynamically).
4. Visual C++ contains two different implementations of iostreams which 
   should never be mixed within one application because this may cause 
   nasal daemons, i.e. application errors that are hard to find.
   The old, now deprecated implementation uses the traditional cfront 
   header files <iostream.h> etc.  The new implementation uses 
   <iostream> etc. as defined in ANSI/ISO C++. DCMTK can be configured 
   to use either of the two interfaces. Currently, the old interface is 
   used for Visual C++ 5.0 and the new interface is used for Visual C++ 
   6.0 and .NET. This behaviour can be changed in 
   config/include/cfwin32.h where the symbol USE_STD_CXX_INCLUDES is 
   declared depending on the compiler version.

   NOTE: Previous releases of DCMTK (3.5.1 and older) used the old 
   interface when compiled with Visual C++ 6.0.  When updating software
   that uses DCMTK as a library, make sure that the use of the iostream
   library is consistent throughout the complete application!


HTML DOCUMENTATION
==================

A few DCMTK modules have been documented with DOC++, a free source code
documentation system similar to javadoc (see http://docpp.sourceforge.net/).
Users who have doc++ installed can create a hypertext documentation for these
modules with "make html" in the module subdirectories. At the current time,
dcmimgle, dcmjpeg, dcmpstat, dcmsign, dcmsr, dcmtls and ofstd are completely
documented, dcmdata, dcmimage and dcmwlm are partially documented. See FAQ
entry: "Where is rest of the documentation?"


COMPILE TIME FLAGS AND ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
============================================

The behaviour of several DCMTK tools and libraries can be modified by a number
of compile time flags (macros). Those macros which are not automatically
handled by the configure mechanism are documented in config/docs/macros.txt
There is also a number of environment variables which affect DCMTK's behaviour.
These are documented in config/docs/envvars.txt
