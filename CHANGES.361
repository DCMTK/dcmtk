Changes between releases are documented here.

**** Changes from 2013.12.20 (riesmeier)

- Fixed comments and documented default values.
  Affects: dcmnet/include/dcmtk/dcmnet/scu.h

- Again, fixed comments to be consistent with code.
  Affects: dcmnet/tests/tpool.cc

- Cleaned up source code in various aspects:
  Made evaluation of command line parameters and options more consistent with
  the other command line tools, fixed inconsistencies regarding log output,
  used appropriate DcmSCU methods when closing an association, etc.
  Affects: dcmnet/apps/getscu.cc

- Removed check on number of command line arguments:
  Since the tool has at least one mandatory command line parameter, there is no
  need to check OFCommandLine::getArgCount() explicitly.
  Affects: dcmnet/apps/dcmrecv.cc
           dcmnet/apps/dcmsend.cc

**** Changes from 2013.12.11 (riesmeier)

- Replaced deprecated DcmSCU::closeAssociation():
  Replaced call to DcmSCU::closeAssociation(DCMSCU_RELEASE_ASSOCIATION) by
  DcmSCU::releaseAssociation() since the former is deprecated.
  Affects: dcmnet/tests/tpool.cc

- Fixed typos, comments and coding style.
  Affects: dcmnet/tests/tpool.cc

**** Changes from 2013.12.10 (riesmeier)

- Second try to fix the issue with "ofstd_markup_6":
  The error in test "ofstd_markup_6" still occurred on various systems.
  Thanks to Mathieu Malaterre <malat@debian.org> for pointing this out.
  Affects: ofstd/tests/tmarkup.cc

**** Changes from 2013.12.10 (onken)

- Fixed some inconsistencies in documentation.
  Affects: INSTALL

**** Changes from 2013.12.05 (onken)

- Fixed typo.
  Affects: dcmtls/include/dcmtk/dcmtls/tlslayer.h

- Documentation for CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE default value.
  Thanks to Mathieu Malaterre <malat@debian.org> for pointing to the fact that
  having no default value in some situations is important and Jean-Christophe
  Fillion-Robin <jchris.fillionr@kitware.com> for giving a solution.
  Affects: CMake/dcmtkPrepare.cmake
           INSTALL

**** Changes from 2013.11.29 (riesmeier)

- Completed support for <InlineBinary> XML element:
  Completed support for the <InlineBinary> XML element used by the Native DICOM
  Model format. Now, also data elements with a VR of OD and OF can be encoded
  as base64. Closes DCMTK Feature #549.
  Affects: dcmdata/docs/dcm2xml.man
           dcmdata/libsrc/Makefile.dep
           dcmdata/libsrc/dcvrod.cc
           dcmdata/libsrc/dcvrof.cc

**** Changes from 2013.11.28 (riesmeier)

- Do not check valueLoaded() for Native DICOM Model:
  Do not check whether a value has actually been loaded when writing an element
  value to XML output in the Native DICOM Model. This is because this concept
  is only known to the DCMTK-specific output format.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcelem.cc

- Fixed output of AT values in Native DICOM Model:
  Fixed wrong output format for Attribute Tag (AT) values in the Native DICOM
  Model. Supplement 166 (QIDO-RS) clarifies that the format is "GGGGEEEE", and
  not "(gggg,eeee)" as it was before (which is DCMTK's default string output
  format for AT values). Closes DCMTK Bug #551.
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dcvrat.h
           dcmdata/libsrc/dcvrat.cc

- Fixed various typos in man pages.

**** Changes from 2013.11.26 (riesmeier)

- Fixed issue with test "ofstd_markup_6" (Win32):
  Fixed issue with test "ofstd_markup_6" not running successfully on Windows
  systems (due to an incorrect length of the input string value).
  Thanks to forum user "ghleclerc" for the report.
  Affects: ofstd/tests/tmarkup.cc

- Fixed minor Doxygen-related issue in documentation:
  Doxygen requires three slashes "///" for documenting entities, e.g. members
  of an enumeration type. One slash was missing for CS_UTF8 in E_CharacterSet.
  Also fixed various typos in comments.
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrtypes.h

**** Changes from 2013.11.25 (riesmeier)

- Fixed name of PN component in Native DICOM Model:
  Fixed name of first PersonName (PN) component in Native DICOM Model.
  According to Supplement 166 (QIDO-RS) the XML element name is "Alphabetic"
  (and not "SingleByte" as it was before).
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcvrpn.cc

**** Changes from 2013.11.21 (riesmeier)

- Fixed minor Doxygen-related issue in documentation:
  Doxygen, the tool that is used for generating the HTML documentation from
  source code, requires that a "." is escaped under certain conditions, e.g.
  if this character does not define the end of a sentence as used for short
  class descriptions.
  Affects: ofstd/include/dcmtk/ofstd/offile.h

**** Changes from 2013.11.19 (riesmeier)

- Added new option for disabling the VR checker:
  Added new command line option that allows for disabling the VR checker by
  setting the recently introduced global "dcmdata" flag accordingly.
  Affects: dcmsr/apps/dsr2html.cc
           dcmsr/apps/dsr2xml.cc
           dcmsr/apps/dsrdump.cc
           dcmsr/docs/dsr2html.man
           dcmsr/docs/dsr2xml.man
           dcmsr/docs/dsrdump.man

- Added global flag for disabling the VR checker:
  Added global flag that allows for disabling the VR checker used by the
  various checkStringValue() methods. Since this checker is currently limited
  to ASCII and Latin-1, and the detection of the character set might fail for
  incorrectly encoded DICOM datasets, this check can be disabled globally.
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dcbytstr.h
           dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dcvrpn.h
           dcmdata/libsrc/dcbytstr.cc

**** Changes from 2013.11.18 (riesmeier)

- Removed redundant and outdated Word document:
  Removed redundant and outdated Word document "wwwapp.doc", which used to
  contain the same information as "wwwapp.txt". Closes DCMTK Feature #556.
  Removed: dcmwlm/docs/wwwapp.doc

- Added missing break statements to switch cases:
  Added missing break statements to switch cases, which previously resulted in
  a wrong return value of the CheckMatchingKey() method. Thanks to Peter Klotz
  <Peter.Klotz@ith-icoserve.com> for the bug report and patch.
  Affects: dcmwlm/libsrc/wlds.cc

**** Changes from 2013.11.17 (schlachter)

- Don't set the defines for thread local storage support incorrectly:
  If DCMTK_LOG4CPLUS_HAVE_TLS_SUPPORT is defined, the code uses it to mark
  variables as thread-local and expects the compiler to implement this.
  Otherwise, calls into the thread library are used. So defining it to an
  empty value makes oflog thread-unsafe. Thanks to Peter Klotz
  <Peter.Klotz@ith-icoserve.com> for the report and a test case.
  Affects: oflog/include/dcmtk/oflog/config/defines.h

**** Changes from 2013.11.15 (riesmeier)

- Avoid CMake warning on non-installable files.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/CMakeLists.txt

- Fixed build issue with shared libraries (Win32):
  Fixed link errors on Windows systems when building with BUILD_SHARED_LIB set
  to "ON". This caused the executables "mkdictbi" and "mkdeftag" to fail.
  Thanks to forum user "lars_matthaeus" for the original report.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/CMakeLists.txt

- Removed trailing white spaces from man pages files.
  Affects: doxygen/manpages/man1/*

**** Changes from 2013.11.14 (thiel)

- Updated man pages for new development snapshot.
  Affects: doxygen/manpages/man1/*

**** Changes from 2013.11.13 (onken)

- Avoid second OpenSSL initialization in constructor:
  OpenSSL's one-time initialization is performed in the TLS layer
  constructor. In multi-threaded environments this leads to multiple
  initialization calls if  more than one association is used at the
  same time. Thus a parameter was added in order to disable the
  initialization code if desired. Thanks to Peter Klotz
  <Peter.Klotz@ith-icoserve.com> for the report and suggested patch.
  Affects: dcmtls/include/dcmtk/dcmtls/tlslayer.h
           dcmtls/libsrc/tlslayer.cc

**** Changes from 2013.11.13 (riesmeier)

- Fixed issue with color icon images:
  According to the DICOM standard, color icon images should always be written
  with a value of "PALETTE COLOR" for Photometric Interpretation. Before this
  fix, also other color models like "RGB" were created for the optional icon
  image of an IMAGE content item. Closes DCMTK Bug #577.
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrimgvl.h
           dcmsr/libsrc/Makefile.dep
           dcmsr/libsrc/dsrimgvl.cc

- Added comment on wrong color model for icon images:
  Added comment on relevant API methods that for color images, the photometric
  interpretation "RGB" is used, which is not allowed according to the DICOM
  standard (see PS 3.3 Section F.7). This will be fixed in the future by using
  "PALETTE COLOR" instead. Noted as DCMTK Bug #577.
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrimgvl.h
           dcmsr/libsrc/dsrimgvl.cc

- Fixed doubled output of XML start tag for VR=OD.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcvrod.cc

**** Changes from 2013.11.12 (onken)

- Fixed doubled tag output in XML output of VR OF:
  Fixed doubled tag output in XML output of VR OF. Thanks to Peter Klotz
  <Peter.Klotz@ith-icoserve.com> for the report and suggested patch.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcvrof.cc

**** Changes from 2013.11.11 (onken)

- Make sure CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE has a default value:
  CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES is set for generators that support multiple
  configuration types (and have per-configuration subdirectories like
  Debug and Release). It is empty for other generators and for those
  generators the build type is controlled at CMake time by
  CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE. Patch ensures that CMAKE-BUILD-TYPE has "Release" as
  a default value. Thanks to Kent Williams <norman-k-williams@uiowa.edu>
  and Jean-Christophe Fillion-Robin <jchris.fillionr@kitware.com> for
  the patch.
  Affects: CMake/dcmtkPrepare.cmake

- Described movescu storage SCP timeout problem:
  In case movescu acts as a storage SCP, it hangs forever if storage client
  never closes the underlying association.
  Affects: dcmnet/docs/movescu.man

- Fixed comments.
  Affects: dcmwlm/libsrc/wlfsim.cc

**** Changes from 2013.11.07 (riesmeier)

- Fixed bug that could cause a crash:
  Fixed bug that could cause a crash when processing an image with an empty
  value for Image Type. This could cause a NULL pointer to be dereferenced.
  Thanks to Tiago D'Agostini <tiago.dagostini@pixeon.com> for the report.
  Affects: dcmimage/apps/dcmscale.cc

**** Changes from 2013.11.04 (riesmeier)

- Added Corneal Topography Map Storage SOP Class:
  Added Corneal Topography Map Storage SOP Class (introduced only recently with
  Supplement 168) to the list of accepted SOP classes, since there still was
  one entry left.
  Affects: dcmnet/etc/storescp.cfg

**** Changes from 2013.10.31 (onken)

- Corrected misleading transfer syntax error message:
  When sending C-ECHO failed because no valid transfer syntax for the
  Verification SOP Class could be found, then a misleading error message
  was triggered complaining about missing Verification SOP Class support
  for Little Endian Implicit. Now the message does only tell that no
  valid presentation context for C-ECHO could be found.
  Thanks to Mathieu Malaterre <mathieu.malaterre@gmail.com> for the
  original report.
  Affects: dcmnet/libsrc/scu.cc

- Support explicit item length denoting too many bytes:
  Added flag that allows to ignore explicit item lengths that denote more
  bytes than the contained elements actually contribute.
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dcerror.h
           dcmdata/libsrc/dcerror.cc
           dcmdata/libsrc/dcitem.cc

           dcmdata/tests/tparser.cc

**** Changes from 2013.10.30 (riesmeier)

- Fixed small issue reported by CMake 2.8.12:
  A trailing "/" had to be removed in order to keep CMake 2.8.12 quiet.
  Affects: CMake/3rdparty.cmake

- Updated CMake version:
  Updated information on latest CMake version that has been tested to "2.8.12".
  Affects: CMake/dcmtkPrepare.cmake

**** Changes from 2013.10.29 (riesmeier)

- Added support for Referenced Segment Number:
  Added support for the optional list of referenced segment numbers to IMAGE
  content items. Partially closes DCMTK Feature #149.
  Added:   dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrimgse.h

           dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrwavvl.h
           dcmsr/libsrc/dsrwavch.cc

- Moved checkCurrentValue() to "protected" section:
  Moved method checkCurrentValue() to the "protected" section of the class in
  order to be consistent with other similar classes.
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrcomvl.h

**** Changes from 2013.10.28 (riesmeier)

- Added comment on getFrameList() method:
  Added clarifying note on the getFrameList() method (based on the DICOM
  standard text, Table C.18.4-1 in PS 3.3-2011).
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrimgvl.h

- Added support for Real World Value Mapping objects:
  Added support for referencing objects of the Real World Value Mapping Storage
  SOP class from IMAGE content items. Partially closes DCMTK Feature #149.
  Affects: dcmsr/data/dsr2xml.xsd

           dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrwavvl.h

- Added comments on missing features:
  Added comments that the conditional/optional attributes Referenced Segment
  Number (0062,000B) and Referenced Real World Value Mapping Instance Sequence
  (0008,114B) are not yet supported by this class. Such still-missing features
  are marked with "tbd" (to be done) throughout the "dcmsr" module.
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrimgvl.h
           dcmsr/libsrc/dsrimgvl.cc

- Use helper method for deleting data elements:
  Use the helper method DcmItem::findAndDeleteElement() for deleting certain
  data elements in all items of a particular sequence.
  Affects: dcmsr/libsrc/dsrtypes.cc

- Iterate more efficiently over sequence items:
  Changed the way sequence items are iterated. Now, the nextInContainer()
  method of the DcmSequenceOfItems class is used instead of getItem(). This
  approach is much more efficient when a sequence contains a huge number of
  items, because of the current implementation of the getItem() method.

**** Changes from 2013.10.24 (riesmeier)

- Adapted test cases for markup conversion:
  Added a new test case and adapted an existing one for the new behavior of
  the "convert to markup" functions with regards to embedded NULL bytes,
  Affects: ofstd/tests/tests.cc
           ofstd/tests/tmarkup.cc

- Never output NULL bytes to markup string/stream:
  Made sure that a NULL byte is never output to HTML/XHTML/XML mnenonic string
  or stream. Only if non-ASCII characters are converted to their numeric value
  (&#nnn;), they will be "visible".
  Affects: ofstd/libsrc/ofstd.cc

**** Changes from 2013.10.23 (riesmeier)

- Added support for new UID from Supplement 168:

- Removed redundant API comment.
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dctagkey.h

- Fixed outdated comment on 1st PN component group:
  Fixed outdated comment on first component group of a Person Name (PN) value.
  According to CP-964, the first component group defines an alphabetic (and not
  a single-byte) representation of the person name.
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dcvrpn.h

- Do not output group length in Native DICOM Model:
  Do not output group length elements (gggg,0000) in Native DICOM Model format
  (as per PS 3.19 section A.1.1, introduced with Supplement 166).
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcelem.cc

**** Changes from 2013.10.17 (riesmeier)

- Fixed wrong content type of XML element in DTD:
  According to the W3C XML specification, "CDATA" is not allowed in the content
  model for elements. So, for the "pixel-item" element it has been replaced by
  "#PCDATA" (which is allowed). Thanks to forum user "wrenashe" for the report.
  Affects: dcmdata/data/dcm2xml.dtd

**** Changes from 2013.10.14 (riesmeier)

- Fixed source code formatting and various comments.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcmetinf.cc

  Affects: dcmwlm/libsrc/wlds.cc

- Worklist SCP support for Responsible Person/Role:
  Added support for attributes Responsible Person and Responsible Person Role
  as Matching and Return Keys to worklist server.
  Affects: dcmwlm/docs/wlmscpfs.man
           dcmwlm/include/dcmtk/dcmwlm/wltypdef.h

           dcmwlm/libsrc/wlfsim.cc

**** Changes from 2013.10.10 (riesmeier)

- Updated comment on current character set issue.
  Affects: dcmsr/libsrc/dsrcodvl.cc
           dcmsr/libsrc/dsrpnmtn.cc
           dcmsr/libsrc/dsrtextn.cc

- Use helper function findAndGetSequence():
  Use helper function DcmItem::findAndGetSequence() instead of the low-level
  search() method, which requires a DcmStack instance.
  Affects: dcmsr/libsrc/dsrdoctn.cc

- Report warning on unsupported character sets:
  Report a warning message on SpecificCharacterSet values that are not (yet)
  supported by the VR checker in the dcmdata module (i.e. all but ASCII and
  ISO Latin-1).
  Affects: dcmsr/libsrc/dsrdoc.cc

- Enhanced implementation of checkCode() method:
  Made sure that the checkCode() method does not reject valid code values that
  use extended characters that are not yet supported by dcmdata's VR checker
  (i.e. all but ASCII and ISO Latin-1). Partially closes DCMTK Bug #547.
  Affects: dcmsr/libsrc/dsrcodvl.cc

- Avoid unnecessary copies of sequence elements:
  By referencing the sequence elements instead of copying, it is also possible
  to access the SpecificCharacterSet element of the surrounding dataset/item,
  which is needed for the VR checker. Partially closes DCMTK Bug #547.
  Affects: dcmsr/libsrc/dsrcodvl.cc
           dcmsr/libsrc/dsrcomvl.cc

           dcmsr/libsrc/dsrnumvl.cc
           dcmsr/libsrc/dsrsoprf.cc

- Added new variant of checkElementValue():
  This new variant gets a pointer to a DICOM element (and not a reference).
  In addition, the getAndCheckXXXFromDataset() methods now make sure that no
  element copy is created _before_ the element is checked. This is because
  otherwise there would be no access to the SpecificCharacterSet element of
  the surrounding dataset/item, which is needed for the VR checker.
  Affects: dcmsr/include/dcmtk/dcmsr/dsrtypes.h
           dcmsr/libsrc/dsrtypes.cc

- Added 'charset' parameter to checkStringValue():
  Added optional character set parameter to static function checkStringValue()
  in order to make sure that only ASCII and Latin-1 strings are checked for
  their conformance with the VR definition (this is a current limitation of the
  underlying VR checker). Also the checkValue() method now uses the value of
  the SpecificCharacterSet element of the surrounding dataset/item.

- Added method to determine SpecificCharacterSet:
  Added method to class DcmCharString that allows for determining the value of
  the SpecificCharacterSet element of the surrounding dataset/item.
  Closes DCMTK Feature #555.

**** Changes from 2013.10.07 (riesmeier)

- Added definition of DCMTK_PACKAGE_URL:
  Added definition of DCMTK_PACKAGE_URL in order to be consistent with the
  GNU autoconf (aka configure) system. However, this setting is currently
  unused and, therefore, uncommented/disabled.
  Affects: CMake/dcmtkPrepare.cmake

- Added two new global flags for VR generation:
  Added global flags for enabling/disabling the support of OF and OD as a valid
  VR. When disabling the support for these post-1993 VRs, OB is used instead.
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dcvr.h
           dcmdata/libsrc/dcvr.c

**** Changes from 2013.10.01 (riesmeier)

- Added trace log message on VR replacement:
  Output message to trace logger when a post-1993 value representation like UT
  or UN is replaced by OB because support for these "new" VRs is disabled.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcvr.cc

- Fixed various coding style issues.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcvr.cc

- Removed superfluous footnote symbol "(*)".
  Affects: dcmwlm/docs/wlmscpfs.man

**** Changes from 2013.09.28 (riesmeier)

- Output currently processed line of input file:
  Output the number of the currently processed text line of the input file to
  the trace logger. This might be useful for debugging purposes.
  Affects: dcmdata/apps/dump2dcm.cc

- Output a warning message if the VR is unknown:
  Output a warning message if the VR of a Tag in the dump file is unknown. This
  could happen if the VR is neither specified in the dump file nor it can be
  determined from the data dictionary. In such cases, the VR "UN" us used.
  Affects: dcmdata/apps/dump2dcm.cc

**** Changes from 2013.09.27 (riesmeier)

- Fixed typo copied from Supplement 163:
  Fixed typo copied from the cover page of the Supplement 163 document.
  Affects: dcmdata/docs/dcm2xml.man

**** Changes from 2013.09.26 (riesmeier)

- Clarified use of writeXML() flags:
  Made more clear which writeXML() flags can be used for which output format.
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dctypes.h

- Added support for <InlineBinary> XML element:
  Added preliminary support for the <InlineBinary> XML element, which has been
  introduced to the Native DICOM Model with Supplement 163 (Store Over the Web
  by Representational State Transfer Services). Currently, data elements with a
  VR of OB, OW and UN can be encoded as base64, i.e. OD and OF are still
  missing. Partially closes DCMTK Feature #549.

- Added missing references to closed DCMTK features.
  Affects: CHANGES.361

**** Changes from 2013.09.24 (onken)

- Create DcmFileFormat from DcmDataset w/o copying:
  Added possibility to create DcmFileFormat from existing dataset and let
  DcmFileFormat take ownership for that dataset instead of always performing a
  deep copy. Closes DCMTK Feature #544.
  Affects: dcmdata/include/dcmtk/dcmdata/dcfilefo.h
           dcmdata/libsrc/dcfilefo.cc

- Do not copy DcmDataset during C-GET receive:
  C-GET functionality does not copy the dataset any more in the standard
  storage handler.

            dcmnet/libsrc/scu.cc

**** Changes from 2013.09.23 (riesmeier)

- Added new option for printing invalid codes:
  Added new command line option that allows for printing also invalid codes.
  Affects: dcmsr/apps/dsrdump.cc
           dcmsr/docs/dsrdump.man

           dcmsr/libsrc/dsrnumvl.cc
           dcmsr/libsrc/dsrtypes.cc

- Slightly changed output of print() method:
  Invalid codes are now printed if the "printInvalid" parameter is true. By
  default, the text "invalid code" is printed in such cases. Before this
  modification, invalid codes were never printed and the behavior of the
  "printInvalid" parameter was different. Closes DCMTK Feature #548.

           dcmsr/libsrc/dsrcodvl.cc

**** Changes from 2013.09.20 (riesmeier)

- Fixed issue with CP-246 files and private tags:
  According to CP-246, elements with VR=UN and undefined length should be
  interpreted as a sequence with implicit VR. This fix makes sure that the
  code also works with private tags. It also corrects a wrong log message.
  Thanks to Mathieu Malaterre <malat@debian.org> for the original report.
  Affects: dcmdata/libsrc/dcitem.cc

- Minor fixes, e.g. added Doxygen markup.
  Affects: dcmqrdb/docs/dcmqrdb.man

**** Changes from 2013.09.20 (onken)

- Warning to re-create index.dat after 20130705:
  The format of dcmqrdb's binary index.dat file changed on 20130705 due to a
  bug fix in the corresponding code. An index.dat file created before that date
  will not work with dcmqrdb code compiled after that date but must be
  re-created.
  Affects: dcmqrdb/docs/dcmqrdb.man

**** Changes from 2013.09.11 (riesmeier)

  --normal and --bit-preserving.
  Affects: dcmnet/apps/dcmrecv.cc
           dcmnet/docs/dcmrecv.man

- Added new dataset storage mode:
  Added new storage mode that allows for receiving a dataset directly to file,
  i.e. the data is written exactly as received. This is what the storescp calls
  "bit preserving mode".
  Affects: dcmnet/include/dcmtk/dcmnet/dstorscp.h
           dcmnet/libsrc/dstorscp.cc

- Receive C-STORE request dataset directly to file:
  Added method that allows for receiving a C-STORE request dataset directly to
  file. Using this new method, large SOP instances can be received with less
  memory requirements and the datasets can be stored as received (i.e. without
  any conversions).
  Affects: dcmnet/include/dcmtk/dcmnet/scp.h
           dcmnet/libsrc/Makefile.dep
           dcmnet/libsrc/scp.cc

  Affects: dcmnet/include/dcmtk/dcmnet/scu.h

**** Changes from 2013.08.29 (riesmeier)

- Introduced dataset storage mode:
  Added new option that allows for ignoring the received dataset, i.e. the
  DICOM dataset received with a C-STORE request message is not stored to file.
  Affects: dcmnet/apps/dcmrecv.cc

**** Changes from 2013.08.27 (riesmeier)

- Restructured implementation of handleSTORERequest():
  Completely restructured the implementation of handleSTORERequest(), which now
  consists of calling 3 separate methods successively: receiveSTORERequest(),
  checkSTORERequest() and sendSTOREResponse(). This could be the prototype for
  all other network messages currently supported by this class. Also regrouped
  the various network message methods.
  Affects: dcmnet/include/dcmtk/dcmnet/scp.h
           dcmnet/libsrc/dstorscp.cc
           dcmnet/libsrc/scp.cc

  Affects: dcmnet/include/dcmtk/dcmnet/scu.h

- Fixed wrong log message in handleMOVERequest().
  Affects: dcmnet/libsrc/scp.cc

- Removed "&" from constant integer parameters:
  Removed "&" specifier from constant integer parameters since passing such
  input values by-reference does not make any sense. Also fixed some layout
  and formatting issues.
  Affects: dcmtls/include/dcmtk/dcmtls/tlsscu.h
           dcmtls/libsrc/tlsscu.cc

**** Changes from 2013.08.26 (riesmeier)

- Removed class name from derived method calls:
  Removed explicit class name when calling a derived method (as long as the
  method name is unambiguous, i.e. the compiler does not complain).
  Affects: dcmnet/libsrc/dstorscp.cc

- Do not copy received dataset in memory:
  Made sure that the DICOM dataset received via a C-STORE request is not copied
  in memory (i.e. to a DcmFileFormat structure) in order to store it as a DICOM
  file (i.e. with file meta information header).
  Affects: dcmnet/include/dcmtk/dcmnet/dstorscp.h
           dcmnet/libsrc/dstorscp.cc

- Fixed various inconsistencies in comments.
  Affects: dcmnet/include/dcmtk/dcmnet/scp.h

- Pass existing dataset to handleSTORERequest():
  Enhanced handleSTORERequest() by allowing an existing dataset to be passed to
  this method. This avoids copying a received dataset to a fileformat structure
  in order to store the dataset as a DICOM file.
  Affects: dcmnet/include/dcmtk/dcmnet/scp.h
           dcmnet/libsrc/scp.cc

- Fixed various typos in comments.
  Affects: dcmnet/apps/storescp.cc

**** Changes from 2013.08.23 (riesmeier)

- Make sure oflog also compiles if threads are disabled.
  Affects: oflog/libsrc/socketap.cc

**** Changes from 2013.08.14 (riesmeier)

- Deprecated closeAssociation() method:
  Added comment that closeAssociation() is deprecated and will probably be made
  "protected" in the future. Instead of that, the methods releaseAssociation()
  and abortAssociation() from the base class DcmSCU should be used.
  Affects: dcmtls/include/dcmtk/dcmtls/tlsscu.h

  the name of the configuration file on the debug logger. Also check the input
  filename for an empty string and return an error code in such a case.
  Affects: dcmnet/libsrc/scpcfg.cc

**** Changes from 2013.08.08 (riesmeier)

- Reimplemented sendSTOREResponse() method:
  Please note that the signature of sendSTOREResponse() changed with this
  commit. There are now two variants of this method: one that is quite easy to
  use and the other that allows for specifying more details.
  Affects: dcmnet/include/dcmtk/dcmnet/scp.h
           dcmnet/libsrc/scp.c

- Use optional fields in sendSTOREResponse():
  Made sure that the optional fields "Affected SOP Class UID" and "Affected SOP
  Instance UID" in sendSTOREResponse() are really used. Also fixed some typos.
  Affects: dcmnet/libsrc/scu.cc
