/** Class managing the SR document tree.
 *  This tree structure consists of content items (nodes) that are related to each other.
 *  It is called "SR Document Content Tree" in the DICOM standard.  There is always a
 *  single node at the root, which has the value type CONTAINER.  Depending on the
 *  document type, certain restrictions apply on which value and relationship types are
 *  allowed.  The rules are specified and checked by a so-called IOD constraint checker.
