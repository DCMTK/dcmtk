     * This function sends a C-FIND-RQ message and data set information containing the given
     * search mask over the network connection to an SCP. Having sent this information, the
     * function tries to receive (one or more) C-FIND-RSP messages on the network connection
     * from the SCP. For C-FIND-RSP messages with a "pending" status (in element (0000,0900))
     * the function will also try to receive data set information over the network (this data
     * set information refers to one record that matches the search mask which was sent to the
     * SCP) and call the callback function which was passed. Having encountered a C-FIND-RSP
     * messages with a "success" status, this function terminates and returns to its caller.
     *
     * Parameters:
     *   assoc                - [in] The association (network connection to SCP).

     *   requestIdentifiers   - [in] Data set object which contains the search mask,i.e. which specifies
     *                               the set of objects which will be requested by C-FIND-RQ.
     *   callback             - [in] Pointer to a function which shall be called to indicate progress.
     *   callbackData         - [in] Pointer to data which shall be passed to the progress indicating function
     *   blockMode            - [in] The blocking mode for receiving data (either DIMSE_BLOCKING or DIMSE_NONBLOCKING)
     *   timeout              - [in] Timeout interval for receiving data. If the blocking mode is DIMSE_NONBLOCKING
     *   response             - [out] Represents a DIMSE C-Find Response Message. Contains corresponding
     *                                information, e.g. message ID being responded to, affected SOP class UID, etc.
     *                                This variable contains in the end the last C-FIND-RSP message which was received
     *                                as a response to the C-FIND-RQ which was sent. Usually, this message will show a
     *                                status of "success".
     *   statusDetail         - [out] If a non-NULL value is passed this variable will in the end contain detailed
