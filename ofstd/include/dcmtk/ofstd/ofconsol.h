 *
 *  Module:  ofstd
 *
 *  Author:  Marco Eichelberg
 *
 *  Purpose: Define general purpose facility for console output
 *
 *  class OFConsole and its global instance, ofConsole,
 *  provide access to the standard console output and error streams
 *  in a way that allows multiple threads to concurrently create output
 *  even if that output is redirected, e. g. to file or memory.
 *  Protection is implemented if the module is compiled with -DWITH_THREADS
 *  and is based on Mutexes.
 *
 *  In cases where DCMTK is used for GUI development, the fact that the
 *  libraries send many error messages to the standard or error streams
 *  are annoying since these streams are not present in a GUI environment.
 *  Either the messages just go lost or they even cause the GUI
 *  application to fail.  This file introduces aliases for the standard
 *  stream handles called COUT and CERR, which are normally only
 *  preprocessor macros for cout and cerr, respectively. If the
 *  toolkit is compiled with the flag DCMTK_GUI defined, however, these
 *  streams are created as OFOStringStream. This will allow a GUI based
 *  application to extract the messages and either present them to the
 *  user or store them in a log file.
 *
 *  GUI based applications making use of this feature should periodically
 *  check and clear these streams in order to avoid increasing consumption
 *  of heap memory.
 *
 *  Caveat 1: The DCMTK command line tools do not yet support the DCMTK_GUI
 *  flag, and will most likely exhibit all kinds of undesired behaviour
 *  if this flag is used.
 *
 *  Caveat 2: The direct use of the COUT and CERR macros is unsafe
 *  in multithread applications. Use ofConsole instead.
