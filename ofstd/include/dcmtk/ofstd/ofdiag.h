/*! @brief A macro for pushing a compiler diagnostic scope.
 *  @note The macro may only be used in conjunction with <i>#include</i>!
 *  @details
 *  If the compiler supports diagnostic scopes, using this macro
 *  will create a new one inside which warning messages might be
 *  disabled selectively.
 *  The macro will have no effect if the compiler does not support
 *  diagnostic scopes.
 *  @remarks Currently supported compilers are GCC (version 4.6 and later, including
 *    derivates like MinGW), Clang and Visual Studio.
 *  @details
 *  <h3>Example</h3>
 *  @code{.cpp}
 *  int i = 3;
 *  unsigned ui = 8;
 *  // will potentially emit a warning, although perfectly safe
 *  if( i < ui )
 *    doStuff();
 *  // create a new diagnostic scope
 *  #include DCMTK_DIAGNOSTIC_PUSH
 *  // disable the sign mismatch warning
 *  #include DCMTK_DIAGNOSTIC_IGNORE_SIGN_COMPARE
 *  // the warning is omitted!
 *  if( i < ui )
 *    doStuff();
 *  // restore the parent diagnostic scope potentially enabling
 *  // the sign mismatch warning again
 *  #include DCMTK_DIAGNOSTIC_POP
 *  @endcode
 */

/*! @brief A macro to disable warnings about variable/type name shadowing.
 *  @note The macro may only be used in conjunction with <i>#include</i>!
 *  @remarks This warning is typically helpful to prevent unintended behavior, however, small
 *    structs often have members with matching names as constructor arguments (for consistent
 *    use/assignment). It makes sense to suppress this warning in that case.
 *  @see DCMTK_DIAGNOSTIC_PUSH for an example.

/*! @brief A macro to disable the Visual Studio specific "performance warning" about implicit conversion
 *    to a boolean value.
 *  @note The macro may only be used in conjunction with <i>#include</i>!
 *  @remarks The warning was meant to indicate that a non boolean value should probably be stored
 *    as a boolean value in the first place, instead of using an integer (i.e. when C programmers do C++).
 *    However, that is hardly ever the case and it is mostly and annoyingly emitted in perfectly fine code
 *    that checks if a value is not equal to zero etc., therefore, suppressing it is usually appropriate.
 *  @see DCMTK_DIAGNOSTIC_PUSH for an example.

/*! @brief A macro to disable warnings about a conditional expression being constant
 *  @note The macro may only be used in conjunction with <i>#include</i>!
 *  @remarks The warning indicates that a conditional expression will always yield
 *    the same result. In C++17, the "if constexpr" statement should be used in this case,
 *    but DCMTK does not (yet) expect a fully C++17 compliant compiler.
 *  @see DCMTK_DIAGNOSTIC_PUSH for an example.

/*! @brief A macro to disable warnings about an assignment within a conditional expression
 *  @note The macro may only be used in conjunction with <i>#include</i>!
 *  @remarks The warning indicates that an assignment takes place within a
 *    conditional expression, which might indicate that "=" was used erroneously instead of "==".
 *  @see DCMTK_DIAGNOSTIC_PUSH for an example.

/*! @brief A macro to disable warnings about raw memory access to class structures
 *  @note The macro may only be used in conjunction with <i>#include</i>!
 *  @remarks The warning indicates that the destination of a call to a raw memory
 *    function such as memset or memcpy is an object of class type, and when writing
 *    into such an object might bypass the class non-trivial or deleted constructor
 *    or copy assignment, violate const-correctness or encapsulation, or corrupt
 *    virtual table pointers.
 *  @see DCMTK_DIAGNOSTIC_PUSH for an example.

/*! @brief A macro to disable warnings about pessimizing use of std::move().
 *  @note The macro may only be used in conjunction with <i>#include</i>!
 *  @remarks The warning indicates that moving a local object in a return
 *    statement prevents copy elision and thus causes less efficient code
 *    to be generated.
 *  @see DCMTK_DIAGNOSTIC_PUSH for an example.

/*! @brief A macro to disable warnings about code that breaks strict

 *  @see DCMTK_DIAGNOSTIC_PUSH for an example.

 *    padded at the end because of a __declspec(align) declaration.
 *  @see DCMTK_DIAGNOSTIC_PUSH for an example.

/*! @brief A macro to disable Visual Studio warnings about non-portability

 *  @note The macro may only be used in conjunction with <i>#include</i>!

 *    that include 'catch' may not support C++ object semantics of
 *    destruction when out of scope.
 *  @see DCMTK_DIAGNOSTIC_PUSH for an example.
