ANNOUNCEMENT

Version 3.6.9 of the OFFIS DCMTK (DICOM toolkit) software is now available for
public release.  This release includes the following main changes over the
previous version 3.6.8:

- DCMTK 3.6.9 builds correctly on older and up-to-date versions of GNU gcc
  (9.5.0 to 14.2.0), Clang (14.0.6 to 18.1.8), Apple Clang (14.0.3 to 15.0.0),
  and Microsoft Visual Studio (2017 to 2022).

- Tested with the following operating systems/environments:
  - Android on arm64
  - FreeBSD on x86_64
  - Linux on x86_64 and x86
  - MacOS X on x86_64 and arm64
  - NetBSD on x86_64
  - OpenBSD on x86_64
  - OpenIndiana on x86_64
  - Windows (including MinGW) on x86_64 and x86

  For a complete list of tested systems and compilers, see the INSTALL file.

- Updated DICOM data dictionary, list of SOP classes, well-known frame of
  references, transfer syntaxes, code definitions, supported context group
  classes, and directory record types for DICOM standard release 2024e:

  - This also includes the latest attributes and SOP classes for the DICONDE
    standard, e.g. for thermography images (based on ASTM E3440).

  - Also updated the DICOMDIR generation code and tools accordingly.

- The new JPEG XL and HTJ2K transfer syntaxes as well as the encapsulated
  uncompressed transfer syntax are now supported for reading and writing, i.e.
  for both files and network transfer.  However, encoders or decoders have not
  been implemented yet.

- Added new command line tool dcm2img that unifies and replaces the tools
  dcm2pnm, dcmj2pnm and dcml2pnm, and adds support for JPEG-LS as an export
  format for image files.  The command line options are identical to the older
  tools, so that dcm2img can serve as a drop-in replacement:

  - By default, the new command line tool determines the output format
    automatically based on the extension of the output filename.

  - The deprecated command line tools were replaced by stubs, which are provided
    for the user's convenience, but will be removed with a future release.

- Added new command line tool dcm2cda that extracts a CDA document from a DICOM
  Encapsulated CDA Storage SOP Instance and stores it in a separate file.

- Replaced command line tool dcmgpdir by a stub that calls the more
  comprehensive command line tool dcmmkdir.

- Further enhanced and updated DICOM Structured Reporting (SR) module "dcmsr":

  - Added support for the new Waveform Annotation SR IOD (introduced with
    Supplement 239).

  - Made URL prefix for hyperlinks to composite objects configurable.

  - Updated code definitions and supported context group classes (see above).

  - Fixed issue with various IOD constraint checkers (see CP-2084).

- Added IPv6 support to DCMTK's association requestors.  All DCMTK "client"
  applications that only request outgoing DICOM network associations can now
  explicitly select the protocol version to be used.  IPv6 support is not yet
  implemented for association acceptors ("server" applications).

- Various TLS enhancements:

  - Added TLS support to the command line tools dcmqrscp and getscu.

  - Added support for the Modified BCP 195 RFC 8996 TLS Profile.

  - Added new command line option --list-profiles to all TLS-enabled tools.
    This option prints a list of the TLS Secure Transport Connection Profiles
    supported.

  - Removed support for OpenSSL 1.0.2 and 1.1.0 and added support for OpenSSL
    3.1.0 to 3.4.0.

- Extended central DCMTK data structure where all SOP Classes are defined with
  their associated properties, e.g. type and sub-type.

- Largely enhanced basic transfer syntax class DcmXfer, e.g. to distinguish
  more clearly between encapsulation and compression.  Please note that some of
  the old methods have been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

- Enhanced performance of OFGlobal class, especially when used in applications
  with many threads that read global objects of this class concurrently.

- New, fully standards compliant implementations of OFStandard::atof() and
  OFStandard::ftoa(), DCMTK's locale independent conversion routines between
  floating point numbers and text.

- Removed support for ICU-based character set conversion.  Since the oficonv
  module in DCMTK supports all DICOM Specific Character Sets, the ICU support,
  which was never complete, has been removed.

- DCMTK now requires compilers to provide conformance to C++98 and supports
  compilation with newer C++ versions up to C++20, which can be enabled via
  CMake's CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD variable.  By default, C++11 is now enabled on
  compilers that support this.

- CMake-related enhancements and other changes:

  - The configure process now respects CMake's CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR
    variable.

  - Exposed the CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX variable to the user.  There are extra
    options to also enable the postfix for Windows DLLs as well as executables.

- Many configure tests related to outdated compilers or libraries were removed,
  thus significantly speeding up the configuration process.

- Fixed various issues that occurred after the official 3.6.8 release, and
  further improved the performance.  See CHANGES file for details.
